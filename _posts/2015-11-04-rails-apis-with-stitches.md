New post on the [Stitch Fix Tech Blog][blog] about how we create Rails-based HTTP APIs using a simple gem called [stitches]:

> With this set of conventions, it was important that developers not feel these were optional features they could leave out to cut corners, so it seemed logical to make it as painless as possible to follow them. The result is stitches, which works as a generator and backing library. It's not an engine or a DSL or anything complex. It's just a bit of Rails configuration, designed to be explicit and obvious.
