In March's [PragPub](http://theprosegarden.com), I've got an article titled “Why You Need a JavaScript Framework”.

> Remember that application you were working on that started out needing just a bit of JavaScript? And then it needed more? And then just a bit more? And then you had a complete mess on your hands?
>
> You can avoid that next time by using a front-end application framework right from the start.

The issue is a couple bucks. Check out the other contents [here](http://theprosegarden.com/contents-of-recent-issues/#03-16).
