Chris White and Jason Harrison of Zeal discussed [my post on developer productivity][1] this week on the [Zeal Interestings
Podcast][2].  It's just 26 minutes long, and hits some interesting points, particular around the use of the word “incompetent”.  They
bring up a fair point, but I couldn't find a better to describe the notion of being given a task that you just don't know how to
complete.
