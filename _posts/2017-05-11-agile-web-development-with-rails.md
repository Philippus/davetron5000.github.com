Hot off the presses is the latest beta of the seminal [Agile Web Development With Rails](https://pragprog.com/book/rails51/agile-web-development-with-rails-5-1), where I'm joining Sam Ruby as co-author.  I'm really excited to be working on this classic book, and doing my part to keep Rails relevant to web developers.

The beta features sections on Webpacker and system tests, new in Rails 5.1.  Much more to come as the beta
progresses!
