Post by yours truly on [Sitepoint]'s Ruby section, "[What You Don't Get With ActiveJob][post]":

> ActiveJob provides simple solutions to two problems faced by Rails developers when writing background jobs: queueing jobs (via the ActiveJob API) and serialization of ActiveRecord objects (via GlobalID).
> 
> It doesn't, however, help with the third problem: writing resilient jobs that can survive in a production environment.
