My new Book, [Rails, Angular, Postgres, and Bootstrap: Powerful, Effective, and Efficient Full-Stack Web Development](https://pragprog.com/book/dcbang/rails-angular-postgres-and-bootstrap) is in beta:

> As a Rails developer, you care about user experience and performance, but you also want simple and maintainable code. Achieve all that by embracing the full stack of web development, from styling with Twitter Bootstrap, building an interactive user interface with AngularJS, to storing data quickly and reliably in PostgreSQL. Take a holistic view of full-stack development to create usable, high-performing applications, and learn to use these technologies effectively in a Ruby on Rails environment.

I've been working on this for quite a while, and pretty excited about it.  If you want to *really* level
up your abilities as a Rails developer, this is the book for you.
