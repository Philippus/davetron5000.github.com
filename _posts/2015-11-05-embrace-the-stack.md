The latest edition of [PragPub] is out, featuring an article I wrote on embracing the full stack.  This is more of a motivator for why
you should be more well-rounded as a developer (which then should motivate you to [buy my new book][book] :).  I cover things from grid-based design to database indexes.

> This may seem like an immense amount of learning and work, but it hopefully feels more achievable now.  You could get a cursory understanding of these topics in a week.  What happens when you do is that you start to take a more holistic view of your application and of how to build features.
