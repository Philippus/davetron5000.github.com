Fresh on the Stitch Fix Engineering blog, the first in a several-part series on the patterns we use in our service-oriented architecture.  From [the intro](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2017/05/09/patterns-of-service-oriented-architecture/):

> Over the last four years, we’ve gone from a team of two developers and one Rails app, to almost 80 developers managing 40+ applications. These applications are a mixture of user-facing and headless services. While our technical architecture isn’t perfect, we’ve had relatively few major problems. Part of the reason for that is that we’ve done a decent job of identifying and re-applying patterns to solve similar technical challenges.

The first pattern is also up: [Asynchronous Transaction](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2017/05/09/patterns-of-soa-asynchronous-transaction/)
