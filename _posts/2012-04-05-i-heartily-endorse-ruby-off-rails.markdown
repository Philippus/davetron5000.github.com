[Jesse Wolgamott][jwo] has launched a training course called [Ruby Off Rails][roffr], which is geared toward helping existing programmers learn Ruby first, and *not* Rails.  

I heartily endorse this and highly recommend this approach if you want to "get into Rails".

<!-- more -->

When I first heard about Rails, I bought a copy of [Agile Web Development with Rails][agilerails] and was instantly confused as to what I was looking at.  What were all those `@` signs for?  Why are there pipes after the `do` keyword?  Where were all these methods coming from?

The answer was: Learn you a Ruby.

I am not the type programmer to just copy/paste code I don't understand.  I don't like "magic<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>".  I want to know, or at least have an inkling of, how the tools I'm using work.  And there's no hope in understanding Rails without understanding Ruby.

I sold the book, and, using a Ruby book available on [Safari], started to learn Ruby the language.  I ignored Rails, and didn't even think about it.  Instead, all of the [command line apps][clibook] that I would historically write in Perl, I wrote in Ruby.  I wrote a *lot* of Perl in Ruby at first<a name="back-2"></a><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.

Eventually, I figured out how the language worked and, when it came time to do some serious Rails programming, I wasn't surprised by much.  I mostly just had to learn to navigate the documentation.  Even when I didn't know how something worked, I could usually have a guess, and I was usually right.  When I wasn't, I learned something new about Ruby.

It probably wouldn't have taken so long if I'd taken a more focused approach like what Ruby Off Rails is doing (and, LivingSocial's [Hungry Academy][hungryacademy] as well, which starts with just Ruby before moving to Rails).

If you're tired of slinging Java/C#/PHP, but can't seem to get focused to learn Rails or Ruby, Ruby Off Rails seems like a good way to go.  It's not very expensive, and it's geared around writing code, not learning API documentation.
