I was fortunate enough to be on the [Tech Done Right Podcast][podcast] hosted by [Noel Rappin][noel].  I was on
with [Zach Briggs][zach] to talk about JavaScript with and without frameworks, something I've been exploring quite
a bit working on the second edition of [my book][book].  Take [a listen][podcast]!
