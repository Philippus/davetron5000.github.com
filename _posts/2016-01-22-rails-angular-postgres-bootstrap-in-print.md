About a year ago, [PragProg][prag] approached me to see if I was working on anything book-worthy.  I'd just created https://angular-rails.com to document
the pain of configuring Rails to do something it clearly didn't want to do—let you write an application with lots of front-end.  Meanwhile, I'd been
learning more and more how great Postgres is.

The result is my new book “Rails, Angular, Postgres, and Bootstrap: Powerful, Effective, and Efficient Full-Stack Web Development”.  It's been in beta for
a while, but official print verison is now for sale.

You can [buy it](https://pragprog.com/book/dcbang/rails-angular-postgres-and-bootstrap) now and start embracing the _full_ stack of web development using
some awesome tools that will serve you well for years to come!
