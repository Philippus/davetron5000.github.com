I gave a talk at [RailsConf '16](http://railsconf.com/) called "Can Time-Travel Keep You From Blowing Up the Enterprise".  The talk is really about scaling Rails on a growing team, and attempts to stop the discussion around "monolith vs microservices" by showing how a team can take hold of its destiny.

It's also the exact way Stitch Fix engineering evolved, and while we have some large Rails apps, none are the monstrosities I've seen elsewhere.
