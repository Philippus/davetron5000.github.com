  <p>Interested in the sorts of things I post about, but want it delivered to your inbox instead?  My mailing list is twice a month, tops, and is nothing but short, useful emails.  You'll get links to blog posts or talks that are <strong>relevant to making your a more well-rounded engineer</strong>, as well as some <strong>exclusive content</strong> that's not available anywhere else.  I'll also have <strong>periodic discounts</strong> or other offers related to my books available to the mailing list. It's really not that muchâ€”sign up below!
