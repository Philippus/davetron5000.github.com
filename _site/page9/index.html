Gatekeeper, in brief, prevents unsigned code from running on OS X.  Although it can be disabled, it&#39;s on by default, and many feel this is the beginning of the end for users having full control of their computers.  I feel the opposite: it&#39;s <em>not</em> a slippery slope, and it&#39;s actually a <em>great</em> feature.  </p>

Let&#39;s explore that and see how to eliminate their use in our tests without making the tests hard to understand.  </p>

The tell-tale sign is a class named <code>ThingDoer</code> with a single method <code>doThing()</code>.  Systems like this don&#39;t arise simply because Java is the way it is, but when you follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> principles (particularly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency inversion</a> principles), your code ends up with lots of small classes that do one thing only.</p>

<p>In Java, you are basically stuck with this, but in Ruby (or any OO language that supports closures/blocks/functions), we can fight this by using Procs instead of classes.</p>

about the overall structure of a test and how that was important to understand the test itself.  A brief review:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Given</em> - Establish the conditions under which the test will run</li>
<li><em>When</em> - Run the code under test</li>
<li><em>Then</em> - assert that the code did what you expect</li>
</ul>

<p>This structure becomes problematic when using either mock objects or block-based asserts.</p>

On the one hand, you want each test to stand on its own and indicate what it&#39;s testing.  On the other hand, just because we&#39;re in
a test doesn&#39;t mean that all the rules about duplication of code don&#39;t apply; tests need to be maintained to, and if you make a
large change, you don&#39;t want to have to change it in several places.</p>

<p>How much duplication is too much or, what does duplication in tests mean, and how does it affect the understandability and
maintainability of our tests?</p>

I cut my teeth on C and UNIX programming, it&#39;s been a while, and I figured I&#39;d check the book out to see what insights it might
have, especially given that it&#39;s written from a Ruby perspective.</p>

<p>In short, I&#39;d recommend this book to someone interested in command-line Ruby (and who might have <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">my book</a>), but who has
very little UNIX programming experience.  This book is a crash-course in the basics of UNIX Process management.</p>

<p>That being said, if you are (or have been) familiar with things like <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>, you&#39;ll find this book a bit too light, especially given the price (<strong>update 1/2/2012</strong> see inside).</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>I&#39;ve spent the last year <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com">writing a book</a> on building awesome command-line applications in Ruby.  Over the course of
writing it, I&#39;ve used a lot of Ruby libraries for building command-line apps, and none of them work quite right.  In my book, I
spent significant time on <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html">OptionParser</a>, since it&#39;s builtin, and <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/gli">GLI</a>, since I wrote it (and since it&#39;s actually very
fully-featured compare to the alternatives).</p>

<p>I just finished up an appendix where I showed alternate implementations of the running examples using <a href="https://github.com/ahoward/main">main</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wycats/thor">thor</a>, and <a href="http://trollop.rubyforge.org/">trollop</a>.  I did this for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>These tools are popular, and people have asked if they&#39;d be included</li>
<li>They are, by and large, very different from how <code>OptionParser</code> and GLI work</li>
<li>I wanted to give them a real shakedown</li>
</ul>

<p>I also surveyed many other tools, but, alas, I couldn&#39;t include everything.  Each of these tools have a common theme, which is to
avoid the boilerplate of <code>OptionParser</code>, and make it really easy to parse command-line arguments.  They all have done this, but at 
a cost.  All of them are less powerful and extensible than <code>OptionParser</code>, and only slightly more compact (or, in the case of
main, more verbose).</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/methadone">methadone</a>, which has all of <code>OptionParser</code>&#39;s power, but the compactness of these other frameworks.</p>

<h3>Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby</h3>

<h4>Control your Computer, Simplify your Life</h4>

<p>Woot!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">My Book</a> is in Beta!  Whoohoo!  It&#39;s all about writing amazing command-line apps in Ruby.  This isn&#39;t about hacking
together UNIX commands, or bash scripting…this is about making apps that are easy to learn, easy to use, easy to write, and
that will delight their users.  Seriously, stop making crappy command-line scripts, read my book, and start kicking ass.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a <strong>long</strong> time coming.  Please stop now, and go <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">check it out</a>.  I started this almost a year ago during
<a href="http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/190">PragProWriMo</a>, where I wrote (almost) every single day in November of 2010.  When I saw that <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">Travis
Swicegood</a> (one of the few who made it all the way through) had gotten his manuscript accepted, I cleaned up a chapter
and submitted and the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com">Prags</a> accepted!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent my time since then writing, re-writing, re-organizing, and working hard to get this thing done.  It&#39;s in beta,
meaning that you can buy the e-book and read the work in progress.  It&#39;s <em>almost</em> complete, just a few chapters to go, and by
reading it in beta, you can give me valuable feedback to make the book even better.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">Check it out</a> now!</p>
