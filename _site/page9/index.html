testing.  My colleague <a href="http://weblog.therealadam.com/2013/01/03/design-for-test-vs-design-for-api/">Adam Keys</a> makes a similar point, though doesn’t call his anti-pattern “dependency injection”.</p>

<p>The scare quotes are because neither DHH nor Tim are accurately representing the purpose of dependency injection.  Dependency
Injection is not about a framework, XML, factories, or testing.  It’s about simplifying code.  Let’s see how.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>There’s been lots of talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_Context,_and_Interaction">DCI</a> in the Ruby community lately.  As I mentioned, I am only partway through Jim
Gay’s <a href="http://clean-ruby.com">unfinished book on the subject</a>, but I ran across a blog post that had a more substantial example in it.</p>

<p>Titled <a href="http://rebo.ruhoh.com/why-dci-contexts/">Why DCI Contexts?</a>, someone named <a href="http://rebo.ruhoh.com/about/">rebo</a>, shows a starting point of “normal” code, then “DCIzes” it, then walks through adding new features to the system.  It’s a bit long, but his explanation is great, and it shows a <em>lot</em> more than just calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">.extend</code> on an object - he clearly demonstrates how roles and contexts are used to implement specific use cases.</p>

<p>Despite the deftness of his explalnation, I find the result code entirely too complex, thanks to confusing abstractions, a
needless DSL and leaky abstractions.  It would all have been a lot simpler if he Just Used Classes®</p>

<p>Let’s see why.</p>

            <p>The ever-opinionated DHH, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3373-getting-hyper-about-hypermedia-apis">on the “hype” about “hypermedia” APIs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The recurrent hoopla over hypermedia APIs is completely overblown. Embedding URLs instead of IDs is not going to guard you from breakage, it’s not going to do anything materially useful for standardizing API clients, and it doesn’t do much for discoverability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Couldn’t agree more. Just getting developers to consume an API that isn’t all POSTs is hard enough.  If “hypermedia” has
demonstrable benefits, I certainly have never seen proof of this, outside of a lot of exasperated flailing.</p>

<p>Remember when “Hypermedia APIs” were called REST?  I do.  From <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2009/03/17/mustbecompliant.html">my post</a> about this in <em>2009</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rest Compliance Officer</strong>: Is there exactly one endpoint, from which any and all resource locators are discoverable?<br />
<strong>Me</strong>: Um, no, that puts undue burden on the client libraries, and over-complicates what we were trying to accomp….<br />
<strong>RCO</strong>: YOU ARE NOT RESTFUL! READ FIELDING’S DISSERTATION, THE HTTP SPEC AND IMPLEMENT AN RFC-COMPLIANT URI PARSER IN THREE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. NEXT!<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using HTTP methods for their intention is great, as is sane URL design, but the fantasy of a generic client that can discover and
navigate every possible operation of a web UI seems like just that…fantasy.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>Over the past several months, the Rails community, at least to my eyes, has become increasingly concerned with managing the
complexity that appears when following the “fat model, skinny controller” advice prescribed by many Rails experts.  The real
issue, however, is <em>reusability</em>.  How can logic be easily used in two places?  In your average object-oriented language, there
are four primary ways to accomplish this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy and Paste</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Composition</li>
  <li>Mixins</li>
</ul>

<p>None are so superior to the other as to always be applicable, so how can we know when to use one over the others?</p>

My assertion is that you cannot, technically speaking, refactor test code, because you have no tests of the test code.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring"><em>Refactoring</em></a> cannot be done without tests that assert that the changes you’ve made haven’t introduced problems.</p>

<p>The discussion put forth a few such tests of tests code, such as running it on prod, having the tests continue to pass, or measuring coverage.  Unfortunately, none of these are sufficient to call changes in test code a <em>refactoring</em>.  I would call it a <em>rewrite</em> or <em>redesign</em>, and I think that the distinction is important.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>We were recently having a discussion at work about “doing it right” and “technical debt”.  The discussion revolved around the
optionality of “doing it right” - when is it OK to not “do it right”?</p>

<p>I would say it’s <strong>almost never</strong> OK to write code incorrectly.  If your understanding of what “doing it right”
means includes an “optional” clause, <strong>you have the wrong definition</strong>.  As professionals, we should always do it right.  We
should always do our work correctly.  I don’t mean we should over-engineer, nor do I mean that we should solve an abstract
problem instead of the one in front of us for “flexibility”, but we should have a basic standard that we inflexibly hold
ourselves to.</p>

<p>Writing code that <strong>does not</strong> adhere to our personal standards of correctness isn’t technical debt - it’s slop.</p>

<p>So, because some industries are still using COBOL, we should stop advancing the state of the art, which involves moving onto more
modern languages than Java, and go help out these poor billion-dollar industries get into the cloud?</p>

            <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts">Steve Yegge</a> has an interesting post up, that classifies programmers along the <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz">conservative-to-liberal</a> axis
(which is, ironically, completely useless in classifying real people’s political feelings):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that my conceptual framework gives us an “out” – a way to avoid being emotional about these subjects. Casting the problem as a clash between Liberalism and Conservatism gives us the ultimate ticket for “agreeing to disagree”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way to avoid being emotional is to…avoid being emotional.  I think that casting the problem as some unchangeable political “stance” is lazy thinking, and gives use the ultimate ticket for avoiding any real discussion.  This way of thinking seems most useful in dismissing arguments one doesn’t feel like thinking too hard about.</p>

<p>Honestly, if you can’t have a real discussion about the pros and cons of e.g. static typing, you either have a lot to learn, or
are not a very capable developer.  If your best answer to “Can we use Ruby on this project?” is “oh, we’re Conservative, so…no”, then you are either have a lot to learn or you are an asshole.  If you refuse to even discuss what the benefits of explicit, yet verbose code are over implicit, but compact code, then you are either have a lot to learn or are an asshole<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As developers, we’re blessed to work in a field full of objective truths.  To avoid seeking them out under the guise of immutable
political stances is the epitome of anti-intellectualism.</p>
