command-line apps.  Thor is a great for writing Rails generators (likely the only reasonable tool), but I wrote GLI
specifically because I wanted a tool tailor-made to write awesome command-line apps.</p>

<p>With the re-release of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dccar2/build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby-2">my book</a>, which uses GLI to demonstrate how to build amazing command-line apps in Ruby, I thought
I’d mimic Sitepoint’s post with a GLI version, and let you decide for yourself.</p>

<p>I use a lot of applications from companies that present themselves as developer-friendly, agile, forward-thinking, and
product-focused.  Despite that, these products have very obvious flaws that, to my thinking, reduce the value to both the company
and its users (unlike, say, Google Ads, which only reduce value to users).</p>

<p>Tearing apart the three apps I mention above will be an undertaking, so I’d like to start with an app I really, really like, and
use almost every day: Square Wallet.</p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">Chromebook</a> yesterday and the keyboard, while sporting the same layout as most other computers, actually
is better designed for what the Chromebook does.</p>

<p>Namely, it has no function keys, instead using them for browser navigation, window management, and hardware controls.  Most amazingly, though, it has no
Caps Lock, instead making it a Search key, which makes sense.  It’s a big key in a very prominent spot and Search is what Google wants you to do.</p>

is:</p>

<p>Oh wait, sorry, that’s the original 101-key version of the IBM PC Keyboard, introduced in 1985.  How’d that get there?  It’s been
almost thirty years, so the CODE keyboard must be awesome, right?</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you are building a new Rails application that runs in an existing technical infrastructure (which is far more likely), then these are the absolute wrong questions to be asking.  Use what your team already uses <em>unless there’s a good technical reason not to</em>.  Why?</p>

<p>Because consistency is far more important than most other factors.</p>

            <p>My ex-colleague from LivingSocial, <a href="https://twitter.com/danmayer">Dan Mayer</a> posted a <a href="http://mayerdan.com/programming/2013/08/04/thoughts-on-continuous-deployment/">great read about continuous deployment</a>, and the tradeoffs when doing an automatic deploy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After considering some of the real world implications of automated continuous deployment, I didn’t feel it was right for our team on most of our projects at the moment. Both because we would need a bit of additional tooling around deployment and dashboards, and because our tests are far to slow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a good (and quick) read. Having worked on at least one of the apps that Dan’s talking about, I would agree he’s making the right call and that if your test suite is slow, automatic deployment can be a killer.  I also think there’s a relationship between the size of the contributor group and the speed of the test suite - the more devs pushing stuff in, the faster it has to be.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">my book</a>, there’s a chapter on bootstrapping new applications, and my recommendation is to set up automatic continuous deployment from the start.  I stand by that, because it basically turns the problem Dan identifies around: slow tests slow your deployment which should thus motivate keeping tests slow (and applications lean).  We’ll see how it works out at <a href="http://stitchfixjobs.com/blog/2013/07/30/our-git-workflow/">Stitch Fix</a>.  We have one app with a somewhat slow test suite, and three with relatively fast ones.  Automatic deploys work really well so far.</p>
