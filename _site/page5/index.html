            <p>My ex-colleague from LivingSocial, <a href="https://twitter.com/danmayer">Dan Mayer</a> posted a <a href="http://mayerdan.com/programming/2013/08/04/thoughts-on-continuous-deployment/">great read about continuous deployment</a>, and the tradeoffs when doing an automatic deploy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After considering some of the real world implications of automated continuous deployment, I didn’t feel it was right for our team on most of our projects at the moment. Both because we would need a bit of additional tooling around deployment and dashboards, and because our tests are far to slow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a good (and quick) read. Having worked on at least one of the apps that Dan&#39;s talking about, I would agree he&#39;s making the right call and that if your test suite is slow, automatic deployment can be a killer.  I also think there&#39;s a relationship between the size of the contributor group and the speed of the test suite - the more devs pushing stuff in, the faster it has to be.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">my book</a>, there&#39;s a chapter on bootstrapping new applications, and my recommendation is to set up automatic continuous deployment from the start.  I stand by that, because it basically turns the problem Dan identifies around: slow tests slow your deployment which should thus motivate keeping tests slow (and applications lean).  We&#39;ll see how it works out at <a href="http://stitchfixjobs.com/blog/2013/07/30/our-git-workflow/">Stitch Fix</a>.  We have one app with a somewhat slow test suite, and three with relatively fast ones.  Automatic deploys work really well so far.</p>

            <p>The Stitch Fix <a href="http://stitchfixjobs.com/blog">tech blog</a> is up, and I just posted <a href="http://stitchfixjobs.com/blog/2013/07/30/our-git-workflow/">how we use Git and Hubot</a> to automate deployment, without having a complex series of
branches and tags.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is fairly simple - new code goes on branches, master is always deployable (when clean), and <code>deploy/production</code> always contains whatever&#39;s on production. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">My book</a> talks about bootstrapping new applications, and my recommendation is to set up continuous deployment.  If you&#39;ve ever worked on a release
schedule, you&#39;ll know that continuous deployment is a pure joy.  It&#39;s also a boon to the users, who get the features and fixes as fast as possible.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>Email is a fact of life.  It&#39;s the primary conduit through which all information in our work life flows.  Clients email us.
Users email us.  Project managers email us. Our issue management systems email us.  Heck, even our <em>apps</em> email us when things are going wrong.</p>

<p>Managing email can be tricky - if you spend too much time on it, you don&#39;t get any other work done, and if you don&#39;t spend enough
time on it, you appear flaky at best and incompetent at worst.  Over the past several years, I&#39;ve developed a system for managing
email as a developer that maximizes my responsiveness without creating an undue burden on my workload.  In short, I&#39;m a lot more
agile in how I deliver results by allowing emails to occasionally &quot;overrule&quot; my otherwise prioritized backlog.</p>

            <p>Last November, I did my own private <a href="http://pragprog.com/news/november-writing-month-pragmatic-guide-to-git-in-print">PragProWriMo</a>, writing every day that month to produce a non-fiction technology book:</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Between Dec 1, 2012 and today, I&#39;ve been editing it, and it&#39;s finally complete!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">The Senior Software Engineer</a> is a 200-page e-book on everything a developer needs to know to be a truly senior
engineer…except for how program.</p>

<p>The book&#39;s subtitle is &quot;A Guide for Making the Most of Your Career&quot; and that&#39;s exactly what it is.  I realized over the past few years
that the best and most successful developers I&#39;ve come across aren&#39;t just good at writing code.  They can communicate effectively
with others.  They can launch a greenfield project without incident.  They can write documentation.  They can lead others without
becoming managers who have to give up coding.</p>

<p>In short, these developers prioritize the delivery of results above all else.  They often (though not always) use software to
deliver those results.</p>

<p>This is the subject of the book.  It&#39;s designed to get you thinking about the big picture, of which computer programs are only a
small part.  It&#39;s a roadmap for advancing in your career without giving up writing code.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also prescriptive.  You&#39;ll learn how to give a code review as well as receive one.  You&#39;ll learn how to keep organized while
implementing complex features.  You&#39;ll learn how to create a convincing technical argument by understanding others&#39; priorities.
You&#39;ll learn how to interview potential team members, and then lead them to successful product delivery.  <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">Check out the website</a>, where you&#39;ll find a full table of contents as well as some excerpts.</p>

<p>The lessons in this book have taken me a long time to learn, and I still struggle every day with many of them. My hope is
that if we all start thinking about this stuff earlier in our careers (at least as much as we think about the next great language or framework) we can do better work and make software better.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">It&#39;s available now for $25, in PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and Markdown</a>.  I hope you enjoy it.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>At <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>, we outsource pretty much <em>all</em> of our hosting and technical needs to Heroku or their add-ons.  Given
where we are now as a company, it makes total sense: we don&#39;t need to hire an admin, we don&#39;t need to adminster actual boxes, and
we can easily add/remove/change our technical infrastructure.  If you are a small startup and you are messing with Linode slices,
   you are probably wasting time.</p>

<p>One thing Heroku doesn&#39;t provide out of the box is a login system for &quot;internal&quot; users.  The vast majority of the software at
Stitch Fix is targeted at Stitch Fix employees - to operate the warehouse, choose what goes into a fix, etc.  The natural way to
allow them to login is via Google Apps.  We can use everyone&#39;s existing username/password, and employees can be added during
onboarding and removed when they leave the company, all in one place.</p>

<p>Getting it to work with our Rails apps <em>seemed</em> easy enough with <a href="http://github.com/intridea/omniauth">OmniAuth</a>, but it turned out to be a lot trickier, resulting in
random failures with the oh-so-helpful error &quot;invalid_credentials&quot;.  Here&#39;s how to fix that, and why you can&#39;t just use the
out-of-box configurations recommend by OmniAuth.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>From time to time, I see people in my twitter stream attempting to switch to Vim.  This is a
good thing.  The problem is that they appear to be viewing the switch as swapping out one
tool for another.  </p>

<p>This is not what switching to Vim means, nor is it a good reason to switch.</p>

<p>The reason to switch to Vim is to <em>work better</em>.  I realize &quot;better&quot; is subjective, but
whatever way <em>you</em> define it is what it means - code faster, edit text more easily, automate
your workflow, whatever.</p>

<p>As such, switching to Vim is to <em>throw out</em> your old editor (or plan to) and replace it with
a <em>different tool</em> that works differently and is, hopefully, better.  Stop asking for &quot;a
plugin that does XXX like Sublime Text does things&quot;.  If Sublime Text has a plugin for what
you want, you don&#39;t need Vim.  Vim might very well have a plugin that does whatever XXX is,
but it&#39;s more likely that you don&#39;t need a plugin, or that Vim provides a way to
accomplish your <em>real</em> goal much more efficiently.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how to make the move.</p>

had to set up manually in the database), and click around to see if things are working.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I <em>do</em> do that, but only when the code is working according to my tests.  Or, when I have to write
JavaScript.  </p>

<p>At my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/02/19/stitch-fix-slash.html">current job</a>, I&#39;m doing a lot more front-end than I had been, and so more

            <p>John Siracusa has, in his laser-focused, analytical style, perfectly captured something about technology that I always knew, but never <em>knew</em> I knew.   His latest post, <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/07/technological-conservatism">Technological Conservatism</a> is a must read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beneath what seems like a reasonable feature request lurks the heart of technological conservatism: <strong>what was and is always shall be.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis his).</p>

<p>I love everything about this, and it&#39;s a helluva lot better than [Steve Yegge&#39;s stinker][yegge].</p>

<p>Siracusa&#39;s article inspires me in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop holding &quot;what I know&quot; so dearly.  &quot;Lead or bleed&quot;, as <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Chad Fowler says</a></li>
<li>Stop accepting unjustified idioms &amp; conventions as being &quot;more correct&quot;.  &quot;That&#39;s just the way it&#39;s done&quot; is often the best
explanation for doing things a particular way, but it&#39;s not actually a legitimate reason for anything.</li>
