            <p><a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">Giles Bowkett</a> posted <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html">a great piece on the deep flaws of Agile processes like Scrum</a>.
It’s spot-on with my experience.
There’s so many choice quotes, it’s hard to pull just one, but I’ll try.
Toward the end of the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve never seen Scrum-like frameworks for transmuting the work of designers, marketers, or accountants into cartoonish oversimplifications like story points. People are happy to treat these workers as adults and trust them to do their jobs.</p>

  <p>I don’t know why this same trust does not prevail in the culture of managing programmers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a job converting JIRA Tickets into Story Points into diffs, I eventually realized that good developers <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/01/27/what-i-learned-working-at-livingsocial.html">deliver results</a>, not promises, points, or even features.
I even <a href="http://theseniorsoftwareengineer.com">wrote an entire book about it</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the <a href="http://tech.stitchfix.com">team at Stitch Fix</a> has no sprints, story points,
velocity, or planning poker.  We just solve the most important problem at hand, and
move onto the next most important one.</p>

          <section class="section-break">
            <p><a href="http://twitter.com/garybernhardt">@garybernhardt</a> linked to a short academic paper on code readability, called <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5257.pdf">“What Makes Code Hard to Understand?”</a>.  It’s a quick read that details an experiment where researchers showed severals versions of the same program to a bunch of programmers and asked them to guess the output.  Each version had the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> and lines of code, but differed only in formatting, variable naming, and use of types.</p>

<p>Choice quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The physical aspects of notation, often considered superficial, can have a profound impact on performance [of programmers to understand what code will
do]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, in a program that relied on order of operations, two versions were given, one in which one space was used around operators (<code class="highlighter-rouge">zigzag</code>) and
another where the operators were all vertically aligned (<code class="highlighter-rouge">linedup</code>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programmers were more likely to respect the order of mathematical operations in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">linedup</code> version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">whitespace</code>, showing how horizontal space can emphasize the common structure between related calculations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, they presented three versions of code to calculate the area of a rectangle, using free variables, tuples, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Rectangle</code> class:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programmers took longer to respond to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tuples</code> version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">rectangle</code> despite it having fewer lines than the <code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code> version. It is not uncommon in Python to use tuples for (x, y) coordinates, but the syntactic “noise” that is present in the tuples version for variable names (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">r1_xy_1</code>) and calculations (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">width = xy_2[0] - xy_1[0]</code>) likely gave programmers pause when verifying the code’s operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was not something that was initially obvious to me as I learned programming, but I have come to realize the importance of typography in writing
  code.  From <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/05/17/source-code-typography.html">my post</a> on the subject over a year ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, it’s not just the content - the code itself - that affects readability. How it’s presented matters and if we’re going to talk about presentation, we have to talk about typography.</p>

I <em>can</em> say what your average developer (including myself) actually creates using object-oriented languages, tools, and techniques.
The result is a constant battle to tame complexity.
I’m going to lay out one source of that complexity, because it’s baked-in to object-orientation, and I debate that it provides any utility in making programs easy to understand or change.</p>

Namely, make your jobs idempotent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trapping <code class="highlighter-rouge">Resque::TermException</code> is really just kicking the can down the road. You might prevent some of your jobs from failing, but you’ll still get failed jobs. Granted, they will fail at a lower rate, but it’s still a rate correlated to the scale of your business.</p>

  <p>The underlying problem is that jobs aren’t <strong>idempotent</strong>.</p>

Let’s forget about that word and just talk about types.</p>

<p>What do we mean by <em>types</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Types are everywhere, they are all around us, even now in your very programs. You can see them when you look at your browser, or when you start up your editor. You can feel them when you go to work, when you go to meetups, when you buy your conference passes.</p>

<p>Morpheus is correct, types are at the absolute core of every program we write, “static” or not.</p>

          <section class="section-break complete-article mb1">
            <p>In reading “The Swift Programming Language” to prep for my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2014/06/04/what-swift-tells-use-about-programming-language-trends.html">post on how Swift informs us about programming language trends</a>, I was surprised at how straightforward the language’s features seemed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found myself nodding along with each feature introduced. Tuples: check. Named Parameters: check. Default Parameters: check. Protocols: check. Functions: check.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized it wasn’t just because Swift has unsurprising features, but because I’m familiar enough with enough other languages
that I’ve experienced or used those features before.  Although I write mainly in Ruby and JavaScript at work, I have a lot of
experience with Java and C, and had my head was in Scala for quite a while a few years ago.</p>

<p>Although the forms of Swift’s various features differ from their analogs in other languages, conceptually, they are the same: the
generic type system is similar to Java’s, and the tuples are close enough to Scala’s that all I need to do is understand the
syntax.</p>

<p>It really is true that the more languages you know, the easier it is to “pick up” new ones.  This is a <em>great</em> reason to 
<a href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">learn a new programming language every year</a>.</p>

<p>If all you know are dynamic languages like Ruby or JavaScript<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, or you are only familiar with Java or C#, you are increasingly at
a disadvantage when trying to acquire new skills.  Learning something like Swift (or Scala, or Elixir, or whatever) requires not
just understanding the syntax of the language, but the very <em>concepts</em> that underpin its features (some of which can be mind-bending).</p>

This is a rare event for us programmers, as we don’t often get to see what the biggest technology company on the planet (who

<p>Swift embodies two major themes in programming language design that have come to the forefront in the last several years:
functions as first-class values (a given, these days), and, more surprisingly, static typing.</p>
