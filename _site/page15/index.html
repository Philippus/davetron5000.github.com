<a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gliffy/tree/master">My command line interface</a> for Gliffy is relatively complete.  It works pretty well, though the error handling isn't very clean.  It's written in Ruby (<a href="http://davetron5000.github.com/gliffy">RDoc here</a>) and can be used as a Ruby client for Gliffy.</p>
<p>
I decided on Ruby since that would be the most fun and didn't require learning a new programming language.  I initially tried to make an ActiveRecord-style domain-based interface, but it was just too difficult and it was hard to see the real benefit.  At the end of the day, I think integrating Gliffy into another application is a relatively simple thing, and a procedural interface would probably be the easiest way to do that.  So, I modeled it after the PHP client library, more or less.
</p>
<p>
The command line interface uses the Ruby client library and provides just the basic functions I need:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="p">&amp;</span>gt<span class="p">;</span> gliffy ls
<span class="m">321654</span> Some Diagram
<span class="m">987654</span> Some Other Diagram
<span class="p">&amp;</span>gt<span class="p">;</span> gliffy edit 321654
<span class="c"># Takes you to your browser to edit the diagram</span></code></pre></div>
I live on the command line, so this is much more expedient than logging into Gliffy and navigating the UI to edit a diagram.
</p>
<p>I'm already feeling like providing access to the folders via the command line would be helpful (they are exposed in the Ruby client of course).  Not sure how much the API will ultimately change (it's in private beta now), but hopefully not too much.  
</p>

<a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a> hooked me up with access to the private beta of their API (which I helped design and implement).  I create a  PHP client and experimental MediaWiki plugin to validate the API while working for them, and now I want to get something else going in my spare time.
</p>
<p>
My first thought was to make a Ruby client, because I think it would be fun and relatively easy.  But, I have to admit that a Wordpress plugin would be more useful to me personally.  That being said, A <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> extension would be useful at work, since we are using Trac (which is python based, and I can't say I'm too interestedin Python at the moment).  I think if <a href="http://support.github.com/discussions/feature-requests/32-wikis-as-git-repository">GitHub allowed git access to project wikis</a>, it would be cool to allow easier integration of Gliffy diagrams to GitHub project wikis.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, I don't have tons of time outside of work, so I want it to be something easily achievable, and also something Chris and Clint are not likely to work on themselves....

        <section class="mb1">
          <div class="excerpt"><p>
So, the "Ruby way" is to use underscores to delimit most identifiers, e.g. "<tt>add_months_to_date</tt>", as opposed to the Java camel-case way of "<tt>addMonthsToDate</tt>".  This was initially something that irked me about Ruby, mostly because typing an underscore is kindof a pain (shift with the left hand and pinky with the other).</p>
<p> Now that I've started working, I've been reading a lot of code and realizing that <b>code is more often read than written</b>.  Ultimately, camel case is a just lot harder to read (especially if you create meaningful method names like myself and my co-workers seem to do).
</p>
<p>
It's pretty hard to defend:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Date</span> <span class="nf">calculatePersonDataUsageHistoryStartDate</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{}</span></code></pre></div>
as more readable than:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">calculate_person_data_usage_history_start_date</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>
The underscores are like spaces, making the identifier a lot more readable.  Of course, both are more readable than:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// Calculates the start date of the</span>
<span class="c1">// person&#39;s data usage history</span>
<span class="n">time_</span> <span class="nf">prsn_dt_uhst_st_dt</span><span class="p">(){}</span></code></pre></div>
</p>
<p>
This would never fly with Java (and, honestly, look a bit weird), but I'm no longer gonna curse the Ruby convention.

Though I'm no longer working for <a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a>, I'm excited to see that <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/blog/2008/12/08/gliffy-online-release-bpmn-symbols-and-folder-management/">they updated their site</a> with some of what I worked on!  Awesome!
</p>
<p>
Specifically, I worked on the folder organization system that they added to replace the tagging system.  This fell out of the API work that I did (which I'm assuming is in private beta right now, but I'm not sure).  I also worked on a feature that, while painful as a developer, is my favorite new thing about Gliffy: the basic account no longer has a five-diagram limit!  That means for free, you can create unlimited diagrams.  The catch is that your diagrams are all public, but I think it's a great way to enhance the functionality while subversively getting their name out to more people.

          <div class="excerpt"><p>
Although <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/daveblog5000/?p=48">RCov makes code coverage in Ruby dead simple</a>, I wasn't sure how easy this would be to achieve with Java.  The first free tool I found is called <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> and it was surprisingly easy to setup, especially since the documentation isn't geared toward getting coverage during tests (but getting it during execution).
</p>
<p>
EMMA works by instrumenting the classfiles to analyze coverage.  Although it can do just-in-time instrumentation, that didn't seem to work for recording coverage via TestNG.  The offline instrumentation makes is pretty easy to use with anything.  Basically, you want your ANT file to:
<ol>
<li>Compile your code</li>
<li>Use EMMA to instrument your classes to a different directory</li>
<li>Run your tests, using the instrumented classes <b>first</b> in your classpath</li> and passing a few system properties to your running code</li>
<li>Run EMMA's report generator on the output</li>
</ol>
At first, I was getting some runtime errors because interfaces are not instrumented (and don't show up in the location you tell EMMA to put them).  The solution is to put <b>both</b> your instrumented classes directory and your regular, non-instrumented classes directory in the classpath, making sure the <b>instrumented</b> ones are first.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/importscrubber/tree/master/src/ant/test.xml">Here's my <tt>test.xml</tt></a> I'm using in <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/importscour/tree">my fork of ImportScrubber</a> that shows it all working together.  All in all, it only took about 15 minutes to set up and debug.  Of course, now, the tests that came with ImportScrubber provide almost <b>no</b> coverage, but that's another story....

So, I am finally employed and I didn't even have to settle.  After a refreshingly protracted and detailed interview process, I'm finally schlepping myself to a job that I'm more or less excited about.  That's saying something, since I've spent the last 8 months at home (6.5 of them working for Gliffy) in my perfect environment: waking up whenever, using my dual-monitor mac, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davetron5000/tags/rudy">Rudy</a> close by.  My first day was a net win, despite having to bring in my own computer, and overall I'm not complaining because I get to use a Mac at work <B>thank GOD</b>.
</p>
<p>
Pluses so far:
<ul>
<li>Smart people I can have a conversation with</li>
<li>Meaningful product (i.e. not another CRUD app for a government agency [not that there's anything wrong with it])</li>
<li>Not only have they heard of javadoc, they use it!</li>
<li>Database migrations!</li>
<li>Clean looking code and tests that actually pass on a fresh checkout!</li>
<li>No M$ exchange server or other shitbox mail system (they use Google Apps)</li>
<li>Damn close to home; I should be biking in real soon</li>
<li>Relaxed environment</li>
<li>I'm one person away from a bonafide window with the shades open!</li>
</ul>
Honestly, it's almost a 100% on my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/daveblog5000/?p=47">interview rubric</a> (which I took down for a while, because some HR person read it and gave me shit about not liking having a dress code.  I mean, does <b>anyone</b> <b>really</b> like putting on a suit and tie to site and write code?  Or to do anything?  We're talking levels of tolerance, and mine is low, mostly because I believe dress codes indicate a deeper organizational problem of priority management).  
</p>
<p>
Negatives so far:
<ul>
<li>Kinda noisy office (fortunately few people seem to have phones)</li>
<li>Subversion (it looks like they aren't going nuts with branches, so <tt>git-svn</tt> should preserve my sanity in this regard)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
On the fence so far:
<ul>
<li>Maven - The only reason this isn't a negative is that it's better than the pile of shit ant script everyone else uses, and the build <b>does</b> work pretty painlessly.</li>
<li>Spring - I haven't used Spring for anything real, and I can't say it gets me excited (nor have I ever thought it sounded all that great), but I'm optimistic about it.  I figure if it, in fact, is great, I'm happy. If it sucks, I have fodder for ranting.  It's a win/win.  I <b>do</b> fear the XML situps tho.</li> 
</ul>

While packaging <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/daves-resume">my resume</a> creator/formatter as a Ruby Gem, I noticed my command line parser was preventing my code from running.  It has this hook that sets up an "auto run" sequence (your code just defines a <tt>main</tt> method):
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">inherited</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">child_class</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="vc">@@appname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">caller</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">][</span><span class="sr">/.*:/</span><span class="o">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">]</span>

  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vc">@@appname</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="vg">$0</span>
    <span class="n">__set_auto_run</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>
the problem is that <tt>$0</tt> from gem is the <tt>/usr/bin</tt> location and <tt>@@appname</tt> is the <b>actual</b> location in the Gem repository.  Not sure why this check was there, but I had a problem.
</p>
<p>
Not feeling like overhauling the command line interface code and not being able to patch OptionParser, I opted instead to use the dangerous-sounding ruby feature of <i>replacing the method with my own implementation</i>:

Now <b>that's</b> pretty cool.  My code just dynamically patches the broken Gem!  The power of open source and dynamic languages.  Of course, this feature allows so much awful code to be written....

          <div class="excerpt"><p>It's been a few weeks of job hunting and I haven't once had to make a decision that <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/daveblog5000/?p=47">my post on interviewing</a> would've helped resolve.  The fact is, you get a feel almost immediately for a place, and the reasons you say "yes" or "no" have more to do with <b>who</b> you'll be working with than the number of monitors you get.  Usually, a place that's using ancient COTS products has put up red flags far earlier in the process.  And the jobs I get excited about have nothing to do with their use of Git.
</p>
<p>
Some lowlights:
<ul>
<li>Left waiting for so long, I had to walk out of the interview in order to meet an appointment.  The receptionist explained "Well, they have a lot of work to get done!"  Good luck with getting it done.</li>
<li>A guy giving a tech interview (for a J2EE position) couldn't understand how a Swing front-end to an EJB/JPA backend could possibly be called J2EE.</li>
<li>Being asked a logic question and, as soon as I used the right word while thinking out loud (in this case "tree"), was cut off and we moved to the next question. After 10 minutes of this, he walked out without telling me anything about the company or job.</li>
<li>Being offered a job after having <b>No</b> technical questions asked of me.  Gee, who else is working there?</li>
<li>Interviewing in a place where <b>every</b> single aspect of the work environment was crappier than the crappiest house I've ever lived.  If <b>I</b> can afford a fresh coat of paint every few years, shouldn't some "global enterprise solution consulting firm" be able to swing it?</li>
<li>A Java development shop using....Visual Source Safe.  I think <tt>cp Foo.java Foo.java.bak</tt> might be better</li>
</ul>
Of course, there's been some legitimate highlights as well:
<ul>
<li>Being asked some challenging questions about concurrency and data structures.  You may not ever have to implement a linked-list, but anyone should know it and when I'm asked, it's a definite plus that the people on the other end know what they are doing</li>
<li>Being asked to write code.  So far, exactly <b>two</b> positions have asked me write code in the interview.  Thank god for them, or my faith would be shaken; seriously.  I'm always <b>very</b> nervous when I'm applying for a job where I have to write code and no one seems to need any proof that I can do it.  It makes me wonder who else is working there</li>
<li>Solid explanations of the business or project.  I used to think this was a no-brainer, but more often than not, I come away from a second interview with NO IDEA what I'd be doing if I took the job.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Criteria is only useful when you have to narrow down a lot of choices.  I'd love to have so many great opportunities that I could just pick the one where I can develop on a Mac, or the one with the nicest office (all other things being equal).  Sadly, that is not the case around here.  It seems very few of my colleagues are being too particular, and I can't help wondering what effect it might have on, well, <b>the world</b> if clueless developers were not as employable as it seems they are.

<ul>
<li><b>Subversion</b> - Git is so much better in so many ways (it goes without saying that CVS should be allowed to die)</li>
<li><b>JUnit</b> - TestNG does all that JUnit does and more; what does JUnit even have to offer these days?</li>
<li><b>Java 1.4</b> - Java without generics is just so much pain</li>
<li><b>Java Web Frameworks</b> - As far as I can tell, <b>none</b> of them adequately address one of the fundamental problems in web development, which is to simplify the creation of the UI.</li>
<li><b>Ant</b> - Ant has always been the world's worst build automation language; who creates a build tool without variables, loops and conditionals?  We can do better (and Maven doesn't appear to be it)</li>
<li><b>Checked exceptions</b> - <tt>java.lang.Exception</tt> is possibly the worst class in the Java library; should never be caught nor thrown<sup>1</sup></li>
<li><b>Misuses of XML</b> - XML has a purpose, and it's not as a programming language or configuration file format.  Any notion that XML is anything other than a <b>binary format</b> is misguided</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><i>
<sup>1</sup>API developers should be allowed to declare that they throw <tt>Exception</tt> to allow subclasses to throw whatever they want with impunity, however <tt>Throwable</tt> is the preferred thing to catch for catch-alls, and the entire exception mechanism in Java is woefully broken.</i>
