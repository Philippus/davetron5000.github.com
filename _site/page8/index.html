            <p>John Siracusa has, in his laser-focused, analytical style, perfectly captured something about technology that I always knew, but never <em>knew</em> I knew.   His latest post, <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/07/technological-conservatism">Technological Conservatism</a> is a must read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beneath what seems like a reasonable feature request lurks the heart of technological conservatism: <strong>what was and is always shall be.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis his).</p>

<p>I love everything about this, and it’s a helluva lot better than [Steve Yegge’s stinker][yegge].</p>

<p>Siracusa’s article inspires me in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stop holding “what I know” so dearly.  “Lead or bleed”, as <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Chad Fowler says</a></li>
  <li>Stop accepting unjustified idioms &amp; conventions as being “more correct”.  “That’s just the way it’s done” is often the best
explanation for doing things a particular way, but it’s not actually a legitimate reason for anything.</li>
</ul>

Twitter good enough?  Why don’t you read “real” journalists instead of blogs?</p>

<p>RSS is a huge part of my online life - every time I fire up Reeder and see stories, I get very happy.  The way I use RSS (which I believe is the best way to use it) can’t be replaced by anything else that I’m aware of.</p>

<p>So, why do I think RSS is so great?</p>

how they solve “The Rails Problem” of complex Rails apps having obese models that stymie code re-use.  The naive approach is just <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/01/02/dci-vs-just-making-classes.html">to make classes</a>.</p>

<p>UserVoice’s approach is different: they made a DSL for describing service calls.  The thing is, it’s sort
of a type system - and a verbose one at that.</p>

What I love about Stitch Fix is that it’s such a simple business: buy clothes for one price, sell them at a higher price.  It’s the very essence of what a business does.  “All” we have to do is find more people to buy things from us, figure out what they want to buy, and sell to them as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Sure, I learned stuff about Rails, Ruby, service-oriented architectures, asynchronous processing, and credit card payments.  But
that’s not what I’m talking about.  Those skills are great experience and will look just fine on my resume, but I learned two
things that made me a better developer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliver results, not promises</li>
  <li>Assume <em>everyone</em> knows what they’re doing</li>

project, didn’t understand what the issue was, and went back to work.</p>

<p>Now, I’m all for bad projects and bad code being called out.  Our industry produces some shitty code, and a general lack of
craftsmanship can kill business, or even people.  So bad code needs to be pointed out.  The question is, is this bad code?  I
think we can all agree that if it <em>is</em> bad code, we should try to point it out in a more constructive way (and I know it’s easier
said than done), but let’s forget the tone and focus on the message.  Is <code class="highlighter-rouge">replace</code> a silly project, or implemented in a stupid
way?</p>

<p>No, it’s not.</p>

the world’s worst straw man I’ve seen.  He talks about <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-01/functional-programming-basics">Uncle Bob’s post</a> on the advantages of functional programming.
Elliotte’s thesis is that Java and JVM just can’t handle this sort of thing, and then sets out to prove this with some terrible code that, unsurprisingly, is terrible.  He takes this bit of Clojure</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">take</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">25</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">squares-of</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">integers</span><span class="p">)))</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>And “re-implements” it in Java.  He does this by implementing <code class="highlighter-rouge">integers</code> to just allocate an array of all the integers.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

testing.  My colleague <a href="http://weblog.therealadam.com/2013/01/03/design-for-test-vs-design-for-api/">Adam Keys</a> makes a similar point, though doesn’t call his anti-pattern “dependency injection”.</p>

<p>The scare quotes are because neither DHH nor Tim are accurately representing the purpose of dependency injection.  Dependency
Injection is not about a framework, XML, factories, or testing.  It’s about simplifying code.  Let’s see how.</p>

Gay’s <a href="http://clean-ruby.com">unfinished book on the subject</a>, but I ran across a blog post that had a more substantial example in it.</p>

<p>Titled <a href="http://rebo.ruhoh.com/why-dci-contexts/">Why DCI Contexts?</a>, someone named <a href="http://rebo.ruhoh.com/about/">rebo</a>, shows a starting point of “normal” code, then “DCIzes” it, then walks through adding new features to the system.  It’s a bit long, but his explanation is great, and it shows a <em>lot</em> more than just calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">.extend</code> on an object - he clearly demonstrates how roles and contexts are used to implement specific use cases.</p>

<p>Despite the deftness of his explalnation, I find the result code entirely too complex, thanks to confusing abstractions, a
needless DSL and leaky abstractions.  It would all have been a lot simpler if he Just Used Classes®</p>

<p>Let’s see why.</p>
