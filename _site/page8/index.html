Sure, we change it, and even occasionally we write new source code, but, by and large, we <em>read</em> source code.  We read it to know how to use it.  We read it to know where to change it.  We read it to understand what it does.</p>

<p>But, it’s not just the content - the code itself - that affects readability.  How it’s presented matters and if we’re going to talk about presentation, we have to talk about typography.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>At <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>, we outsource pretty much <em>all</em> of our hosting and technical needs to Heroku or their add-ons.  Given
where we are now as a company, it makes total sense: we don’t need to hire an admin, we don’t need to adminster actual boxes, and
we can easily add/remove/change our technical infrastructure.  If you are a small startup and you are messing with Linode slices,
   you are probably wasting time.</p>

<p>One thing Heroku doesn’t provide out of the box is a login system for “internal” users.  The vast majority of the software at
Stitch Fix is targeted at Stitch Fix employees - to operate the warehouse, choose what goes into a fix, etc.  The natural way to
allow them to login is via Google Apps.  We can use everyone’s existing username/password, and employees can be added during
onboarding and removed when they leave the company, all in one place.</p>

<p>Getting it to work with our Rails apps <em>seemed</em> easy enough with <a href="http://github.com/intridea/omniauth">OmniAuth</a>, but it turned out to be a lot trickier, resulting in
random failures with the oh-so-helpful error “invalid_credentials”.  Here’s how to fix that, and why you can’t just use the
out-of-box configurations recommend by OmniAuth.</p>

          <div class="excerpt"><p>From time to time, I see people in my twitter stream attempting to switch to Vim.  This is a
good thing.  The problem is that they appear to be viewing the switch as swapping out one
tool for another.</p>

<p>This is not what switching to Vim means, nor is it a good reason to switch.</p>

<p>The reason to switch to Vim is to <em>work better</em>.  I realize “better” is subjective, but
whatever way <em>you</em> define it is what it means - code faster, edit text more easily, automate
your workflow, whatever.</p>

<p>As such, switching to Vim is to <em>throw out</em> your old editor (or plan to) and replace it with
a <em>different tool</em> that works differently and is, hopefully, better.  Stop asking for “a
plugin that does XXX like Sublime Text does things”.  If Sublime Text has a plugin for what
you want, you don’t need Vim.  Vim might very well have a plugin that does whatever XXX is,
but it’s more likely that you don’t need a plugin, or that Vim provides a way to
accomplish your <em>real</em> goal much more efficiently.</p>

<p>Here’s how to make the move.</p>

up a browser, log in as the right person, navigate to just the right piece of data (which I
had to set up manually in the database), and click around to see if things are working.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I <em>do</em> do that, but only when the code is working according to my tests.  Or, when I have to write
JavaScript.</p>

<p>At my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/02/19/stitch-fix-slash.html">current job</a>, I’m doing a lot more front-end than I had been, and so more
JavaScript.  The app I’m working on is a Rails app, and so I looked into the current state of
the art with testing JavaScript.</p>

            <p>John Siracusa has, in his laser-focused, analytical style, perfectly captured something about technology that I always knew, but never <em>knew</em> I knew.   His latest post, <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/07/technological-conservatism">Technological Conservatism</a> is a must read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beneath what seems like a reasonable feature request lurks the heart of technological conservatism: <strong>what was and is always shall be.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis his).</p>

<p>I love everything about this, and it’s a helluva lot better than [Steve Yegge’s stinker][yegge].</p>

<p>Siracusa’s article inspires me in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stop holding “what I know” so dearly.  “Lead or bleed”, as <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Chad Fowler says</a></li>
  <li>Stop accepting unjustified idioms &amp; conventions as being “more correct”.  “That’s just the way it’s done” is often the best
explanation for doing things a particular way, but it’s not actually a legitimate reason for anything.</li>

how they solve “The Rails Problem” of complex Rails apps having obese models that stymie code re-use.  The naive approach is just <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/01/02/dci-vs-just-making-classes.html">to make classes</a>.</p>

<p>UserVoice’s approach is different: they made a DSL for describing service calls.  The thing is, it’s sort
of a type system - and a verbose one at that.</p>

My tenure at LivingSocial was short - it would’ve certainly been longer had this opportunity not come along - but I learned a lot in the 14 months I worked there.</p>

<p>Sure, I learned stuff about Rails, Ruby, service-oriented architectures, asynchronous processing, and credit card payments.  But
that’s not what I’m talking about.  Those skills are great experience and will look just fine on my resume, but I learned two
things that made me a better developer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliver results, not promises</li>
  <li>Assume <em>everyone</em> knows what they’re doing</li>
