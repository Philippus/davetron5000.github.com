I find that Scala is one giant <a href="">Rube Goldberg Machine</a> that manages to do something not easily be done otherwise.  By this I mean that Scala has many features that, by themselves, seem very strange, but, in combination, enable some very cool functionality.  This is why I initially started my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour">personal tour of Scala</a>.  I read stuff like <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ExplcitlyTypedSelfReferences">explicitly typed self-references</a> and was left scratching my head.
</p>
<p>
I thought it might be fun to deconstruct the "map literal" in Scala and observie how the features interact to create a very handy piece of code that isn't baked into the language.  This assumes and understanding of some <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaBasics">Scala basics</a>.
</p>
<p>
Although Java 7 is getting map literals, Scala already has it (or so it appears):

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">band</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Dave&quot;</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Bass&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span>
                <span class="s">&quot;Tony&quot;</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Guitar&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span>
                <span class="s">&quot;Greg&quot;</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Drums&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></div>
This is not actually a literal, but enabled by Scala features to make it look like a literal.  Which means that you can use these facilities to make your own literals.  So, how does this work?
</p>
<p>
Most surprising to a Java programmer is the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator.  This makes use of two Scala features:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaOperators">Operator-like method naming</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ImplicitConversions">Implicit Conversions</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator is on the class <tt>Predef.ArrowAssoc</tt>.  <tt>Predef</tt> is automatically imported in every Scala program, so you don't need to prefix anything with <tt>Predef</tt>.  It returns a tuple of its caller and its argument, e.g.
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">dave</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrowAssoc</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Dave&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">entry</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">dave</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Bass&quot;</span>
<span class="c1">// entry is now (&quot;Dave&quot;,&quot;Bass&quot;)</span>
<span class="c1">// which is a Tuple2[String,String]</span></code></pre></div>
</p>
<p>
Of course, we aren't creating <tt>ArrowAssoc</tt> instances anywhere, so how does this get called?  This is where implicits come in.  Suppose we change our simple example to:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">dave</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Dave&quot;</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">entry</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">dave</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Bass&quot;</span>
<span class="c1">// entry is still (&quot;Dave&quot;,&quot;Bass&quot;)</span>
<span class="c1">// which is a Tuple2[String,String]</span></code></pre></div>
Here, Scala sees that the method <tt>-&gt;</tt> needs to be called on an <tt>ArrowAssoc</tt>, but is being called on a <tt>String</tt>.  Instead of giving up, Scala notices the method: 
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">implicit</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">any2ArrowAssoc</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">](</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="k">:</span> 
  <span class="kt">ArrowAssoc</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrowAssoc</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></div>
This means that anything at all can be converted into an <tt>ArrowAssoc</tt> if there's some reason to.  And we have a reason to here.
</p>
<p>
This means our code is now effectively:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">band</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="s">&quot;Dave&quot;</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Bass&quot;</span><span class="o">),</span>
                <span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Tony&quot;</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Guitar&quot;</span><span class="o">),</span>
                <span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Greg&quot;</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Drums&quot;</span><span class="o">))</span></code></pre></div>
It's not hard to imagine a <tt>Map</tt> constructor taking <tt>Tuple2</tt>, using the first part as the key and the second part as the value, however where is the constructor?  Scala creates objects via the <tt>new</tt> keyword, just as Java does.  So, what's going on here?
</p>
<p>
This use two additional Scala features:
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaBasics#Literals_and_Syntactic_Sugar"><tt>apply()</tt>
        shortcutting</a>
    <li><a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/ScalaObject">Scala singleton objects</a></li>
</ol>
This is much simpler to decode than the <tt>-&gt;</tt> method; there is simply an object in scope named <tt>Map</tt>, and it has an <tt>apply</tt> method that takes a variable list of <tt>Tuple2</tt> objects.  Scala interprets a method-call syntax on an object, but lacking a method name, as a call to the <tt>apply</tt> method of that object (if it exists).  So, removing this, we have:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">band</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apply</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="s">&quot;Dave&quot;</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Bass&quot;</span><span class="o">),</span>
                      <span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Tony&quot;</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Guitar&quot;</span><span class="o">),</span>
                      <span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Greg&quot;</span> <span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Drums&quot;</span><span class="o">))</span></code></pre></div>
</p>
<p>
That's all there is to it!  A few things to note about this:
<ul>
    <li>Without the application of some Scala features, it's pretty ugly</li>
    <li>The language itself didn't need to implement a special "map literal"; it simply combines smaller features
    in a way to make it appear as though it does.  You can even create your own "literals" rather than waiting for
    the language to implement them</li>
</ul>
