<div><p><em>See <a href="/blog/2010/06/27/iphone-app-part-2.html">Part 1</a> and <a href="/blog/2010/06/27/iphone-app-part-2.html">Part 2</a> first</em></p>

<p>Just a quick update for tonight.  I&#39;m starting to get the hang of how the user interface elements I create in Interface Builder get hooked up and become available in code.  It&#39;s a bit odd and not terribly intuitive, but it&#39;s starting to make a <em>bit</em> more sense.  Under the covers there&#39;s some sort of dependency injection going on (even if Apple doesn&#39;t call it that) that smells of Spring-style magic; objects get created for me and populated if I do the right thing.</p>

<p>At any rate, I decided that, before making any more changes, I needed to get a reasonable data set into the app.  I spent two painful hours exporting my Google Doc Wine Brain into CSV and parsing it with Objective-C, mapping it to my Core Data model objects.  In the end, I was successful, but, WOW, what a pain compared to Ruby or Perl.  </p>

<p>Seeing this large set of data on the home screen was very motivational to start working on a drill-down/search interface, as you can see here:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wine_brain_all_wines.jpg" alt="All Wines List"></p>

<p>Before delving into my new homescreen, I decided to work up a better color scheme that was more &quot;wine-like&quot;.  I&#39;m not a big fan of apps that have fancy graphics and obscure the idiomatic iPhone UI, but a bit of a color splash would go a long way (and, not to mention, be well within my graphic design skill level).  In addition, more user testing (via Amy once again) revealed that the rating control needed a much starker contrast between the selected and unselected choices.  There isn&#39;t much I have control over via the API for this, so I chose an alternate style of <code>UISegmentedControl</code> that used the &quot;iPhone blue&quot; for the selected state.  I think it works OK with the color scheme, though I&#39;d prefer the &quot;merlot red&quot; that I chose for the nav bar and wine type:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wine_brain_new_wine_4.jpg" alt="Colorrific New Wine Screen"></p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think that my desire to have wine entry confined to one screen might not pan out.  The &quot;slot-machine&quot; control will become more and more unusable as more varietals are added, and there&#39;s really no way to even <em>add</em> a new varietal here.  I think I may have to go with the drill-down method where by I push another table view onto the stack to select (and possibly add) a varietal.  For another day.</p>

<p>Lastly, I took a stab at a better home screen:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wine_brain_homescreen.jpg" alt="Home Screen"></p>

<p>This pretty-well represents the ways I <em>think</em> I&#39;d want to navigate the data.  Time will tell once I implement these searches, but this seems like a reasonable start.</p>

<p>I also have to say that, despite Objective-C&#39;s overall wackiness, it was pretty easy to put this together and have the &quot;Add New Wine&quot; button bring up the &quot;Add Wine&quot; screen and to have the &quot;All Wines&quot; button navigate to the old home screen.  Apple has done a reasonable job of making it easy to make an idiomatic, normal-looking iPhone app.</p>
