<p>I&#39;ve been working on the app more than my recent lack of blog entries indicates.  At this point, I have what could roughly be called a beta version; almost all the features are there, and things seem to be generally working pretty well.  </p>

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<p>The biggest change in the UX is the ability to add tasting notes, date tasted, and location tasted.  This is a new screen accessible from the main entry screen.  The most obvious way to do this in my mind, was a big button at the bottom:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wine_brain_new_wine_5.jpg" alt="New Add Screen"></p>

<p>In designing the new screen, 
the &quot;where tasted&quot; and &quot;when tasted&quot; were straightforward; I used stock controls.  For the tasting notes, I needed a <code>UITextView</code>, which is akin to an HTML <code>TEXTAREA</code>.  The visual appearance of this control is pretty lacking compared to the <code>UITextField</code>; there is no nice beveled edge, no rounded corners, and no placeholder text.  I really just wanted a multi-line field much like the <code>UITextField</code>, but there is nothing available to create that.</p>

<p>So, I hacked something together.</p>

<p>An option for the <code>UITextField</code>&#39;s appearance is to have a beveled edge with square corners.  In this configuration, you can adjust the height of the text field.  So, I placed such a field on the screen and sized it about the size of my tasting notes field and made the background color white.  I then put the tasting notes field on top of it, with a clear background color, and, well, it looked pretty good:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wine_brain_new_wine_details.jpg" alt="Details Screen"></p>

<p>I then implemented some <code>UITextViewDelegate</code> methods to give the apperance of placeholder text:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="p">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">BOOL</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">textViewShouldBeginEditing:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">UITextView</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">textView</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">([</span><span class="n">textView</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">text</span> <span class="nl">isEqualToString</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">DEFAULT_TASTING_NOTES_TEXT</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">textView</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">@&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">YES</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">textViewDidEndEditing:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">UITextView</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">textView</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">([</span><span class="n">textView</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">text</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">textView</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DEFAULT_TASTING_NOTES_TEXT</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I considered using some third-party controls that mimic this behavior, but didn&#39;t want to get side-tracked adding new frameworks to my app at this point.</p>

<h2>User Testing</h2>

<p>Once I had this, I handed my phone to Amy for some more user testing; She brought up a few obvious things that I had completely internalized and begun ignoring:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking &quot;Save&quot; on the details screen brought you back to the &quot;new wine&quot; screen, instead of just saving and bringing you back to the top.  A minor but obvious annoyance.</li>
<li>She kept tapping on the &quot;Choose Varietal&quot; text field, thinking that would bring up the varietal chooser, instead of clicking the much smaller blue &quot;disclosure&quot; button</li>
<li>She was a bit sad that the wines we had entered in the app would not be available on our shared Google Spreadsheet</li>
</ul>

<p>To smooth the navigation after saving, I used a stock feature of the <code>UINavigationController</code> to &quot;pop&quot; more than once up the chain.  Since my design of the details screen used Apple&#39;s delegate pattern (essentially, the &quot;add new wine&quot; view controller was the delegate to the details view&#39;s lifecycle; when you click &quot;Save&quot; on the detail view, it triggers a callback in the &quot;add new wine&quot; view controller; the perfect place to save before the detail view controller popped back two screens).</p>

<p>The problem with the &quot;Choose Varietal&quot; control had bugged me, too, but I got used to it and didn&#39;t think about it.  The solution was very simple, though hacky.  I placed a clear button on top of the field the exact size of the field and had it trigger the same action as the blue disclosure button.  Problem solved.</p>

<p>As to maintaining the list up on Google Docs, I think I may need to implement this sooner rather than later; I think it&#39;s important to be able to get your data out of an application, and Google Docs is a reasonably user-friendly way to do it (as opposed to emailing some CSV file).  </p>

<h2>Other Random Bits</h2>

<p>I still didn&#39;t get around to setting up iCuke for testing; I really should because I don&#39;t know what missing <code>retain</code> calls might be lurking.  I also finally created an icon, using a picture I took in Napa.  Not sure I like it, but it beats the white blob:</p>

<p>(Taken from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davetron5000/3805675435/">my original</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, the app no longer starts up on the actual device.  A seemingly serious problem that I assume would be remedied by a re-install from scratch, however I have a few wines that I&#39;ve added and don&#39;t particularly wanted to lose them.  Not sure how I could gain access to the SQL database to get them out, but I&#39;m currently downloading the 4.0.1 update for my phone and the 2+ GB SDK update (!).</p>

<p><em>As a followup, I had to re-install the application from scratch, though I was able to access the SQLite database from an iTunes backup.  I <em>really</em> need to implement a quicker backup/export mechanism...</em></p>
