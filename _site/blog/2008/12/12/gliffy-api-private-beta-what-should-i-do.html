<a href="http://www.gliffy.com">Gliffy</a> hooked me up with access to the private beta of their API (which I helped design and implement).  I create a  PHP client and experimental MediaWiki plugin to validate the API while working for them, and now I want to get something else going in my spare time.
</p>
<p>
My first thought was to make a Ruby client, because I think it would be fun and relatively easy.  But, I have to admit that a Wordpress plugin would be more useful to me personally.  That being said, A <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> extension would be useful at work, since we are using Trac (which is python based, and I can't say I'm too interestedin Python at the moment).  I think if <a href="http://support.github.com/discussions/feature-requests/32-wikis-as-git-repository">GitHub allowed git access to project wikis</a>, it would be cool to allow easier integration of Gliffy diagrams to GitHub project wikis.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, I don't have tons of time outside of work, so I want it to be something easily achievable, and also something Chris and Clint are not likely to work on themselves....
