<div><p>I&#39;ve always liked superhero stuff, but was never into comics as a kid.
Reading Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashpoint_(comics)">summaries</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Crisis">insanity</a> that is the DC universe&#39;s continuity makes me never want to touch the stuff.  Now, it seems, they&#39;ve thrown all of that out and started things fresh.  Though it&#39;s not a reboot.  Whatever.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Having zero desire to locate, much less visit, my local comics store, the awesome <a href="http://www.comixology.com/">Comixology</a> app is
my gateway to nerdom.  I&#39;ve used it to read a few  short-run titles like Kick-Ass and Wanted, and they carry the DC titles.
<strong>And</strong>, the New 52 titles are being released digitally at the same time as they are in print.  Awesome.  Nothing more annoying
than downloading some 5 year old comic that just abruptly ends because they didn&#39;t feel like digitizing all of it.</p>

<p>Based on what I know about the characters, and a few recommendations, I got the #1&#39;s for several of the new titles:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Action Comics</em> - Superman&#39;s young and pissed, and Lex Luthor is out to get him.  Love this one.  And, I&#39;m cool with his costume being jeans and a T-shirt. </li>
<li><em>All Star Western</em> - Jonah Hex is a kick-ass dude in 1800s Gotham City.  I like the vibe, but the story seemed a bit formulaic,
and I&#39;m not sure I care about yet another grumpy badass character.  I&#39;ll read #2 and see if it picks up.</li>
<li><em>Batman</em> - YES.  So very good.  The first two issues deal with some shadowy assasins coming to Gotham and Batman is ready to
kick some serious ass.</li>
<li><em>Batwoman</em> - No clue who or what Batwoman is supposed to be.  I bought the first two issues based on a recommendation and I
probably won&#39;t continue.  Story is kinda boring and the character just doesn&#39;t interest me.  Plus, it seems the bad guys are
stupid supernatural demons or something, and I just hate that stuff.</li>
<li><em>Catwoman</em> - Dumb fun.  This one&#39;s been getting flak for it&#39;s overt sexuality, but I love the idea of a character who&#39;s in it
for herself and not trying to be a hero.  The scene in the second issue with Bruce acting like a drunken idiot while watching
Selina&#39;s every move is awesome.  Definitely keep reading this one.</li>
<li><em>Detective Comics</em> - I dont even remember what this one&#39;s about.  Batman plus blood-n-guts.  I dunno.  Wasn&#39;t really into it,
and <em>Batman</em> is just way better so far.</li>
<li><em>Justice League</em> - Love it.  The League hasn&#39;t formed, no one knows each other <em>or</em> trusts each other and the government&#39;s out
to get all the heros.  And Darkseid is sending bombs and dudes to Earth.  Green Lantern: &quot;You&#39;re not just some guy in a bat
costume are you?&quot;.  Ha!</li>
<li><em>Wonder Woman</em> - REALLY boring.  No idea what the story is, but there&#39;s centaurs and Zeus and other boring shit I can&#39;t stand.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the new 52 titles don&#39;t look super interesting to me; I think a lot of the Justice League characters are kinda boring
on their own, with Superman and Batman being the exception.  The other &quot;Bat family&quot; titles look OK, but I&#39;m pretty happy with
what I&#39;ve got for the time being.</p>

<p>The only thing I don&#39;t get how all this fits together; Batman&#39;s in three of the titles I&#39;m reading, and so is it the same guy at
different points, or totally different stories that are timeless or what?  Ah well. </p>
