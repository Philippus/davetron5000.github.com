    <p>I just finished reading the short and to-the-point <a href="http://workingwithunixprocesses.com/">Working with Unix Processes</a>, by Jess Storimer.  Although
I cut my teeth on C and UNIX programming, it&#39;s been a while, and I figured I&#39;d check the book out to see what insights it might
have, especially given that it&#39;s written from a Ruby perspective.</p>

<p>In short, I&#39;d recommend this book to someone interested in command-line Ruby (and who might have <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">my book</a>), but who has
very little UNIX programming experience.  This book is a crash-course in the basics of UNIX Process management.</p>

<p>That being said, if you are (or have been) familiar with things like <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>, you&#39;ll find this book a bit too light, especially given the price (<strong>update 1/2/2012</strong> see inside).</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>The information in the book is accurate and presented at excellent pace; the reader isn&#39;t expected to ingest too much knowledge
at once, and the author brings the reader one step-at-a-time through understanding UNIX process management.  In a nice touch, the author pauses on occasion to connect the information presented to &quot;real world&quot; scenarios.</p>

<p>The book also delves slightly into the realities of using these tools in the context of particualr Ruby implementations.  </p>

<p>The appendeces of the book are a walkthrough of certain parts of <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a> and <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">unicorn&#39;s</a> source code,
relating back to the concepts learned in the book.  This is something few books do, but that I find very illuminating.  Here, it
demonstrates real-world use of the concepts outlined in the book.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>At $27 ($7 <em>more</em> than <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com/">my book</a>, and <em>$22 more</em> that Avdi Grimm&#39;s so-far-wonderful <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/">Objects on Rails</a>), I was hoping for a little more depth.  The book clocks in at 90 pages in PDF (77 pages
  in iBooks) and feels more like an introduction.    For the price, I was hoping for a lot more depth.</p>

<p>As an example, the section &quot;Daemon Processes&quot; shows the use of the <code>setsid</code> system call.  Although the purpose of using the call
is explained, <em>that</em> explanation makes no sense.  I have no idea what a &quot;session leader&quot; or &quot;process group&quot; are, and these terms
are never touched on in the book, nor is there a link to find out more.  A cursory search of the internet turned up only the
information presented here.  Piecing this together is the insight a book like this should provide; it&#39;s what makes the
information worth paying for.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1/2/2012</strong>: <em><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jstorimer">The author</a> has recently updated the book to include a *much</em> more detailed explanation of 
<code>setsid</code> and all of the process stuff around it.  The update makes it very clear how the quoted <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">rack</a> daemon
process code works and was very illuminating.  This demonstrates one of the cool things about ebooks - easy updates.*</p>

<p>I also feel like some discussion of named pipes would be warranted, as well as things like <code>select</code> and <code>poll</code>, which are at the
heart of the current fad in evented programming.</p>

<p>The book could also benefit from some editing, as there were <em>just</em> enough grammar and spelling mistakes to distract me, as well as numerous formatting bugs with source code in the ePub version.  I also think that using running, real-world examples would make the points more clear; the examples aren&#39;t particularly compelling (although the appendeces make up for this significantly, since they <em>do</em> relate the concepts to real code).</p>

<p>The book also includes some source code that is never really discussed and, honestly, I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m supposed to do with
it.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Don&#39;t let these criticisms spoil you, though.  If you have no clue what a process is, or what <code>exec</code> is for, this book will teach
that to you, simply and quickly.  This book fills a gap that a lot of developers have these days; it shouldn&#39;t require writing C
code to learn the UNIX fundamentals.  This book proves that to be true.</p>
