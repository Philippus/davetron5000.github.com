    <p>At <a href="http://www.rubynation.org">RubyNation</a>, I gave a talk on <a href="http://awesome-cli-ruby.heroku.com">Making Awesome Command Line Applications in Ruby</a>, which I’ve done a few times, and is what led to my currently-in-progress book on the subject.</p>

<p>One of the assertions I added to the talk, based on my work on the book is the specific advice to not start off in bash…use Ruby.  This was questioned by a member of the audience (who I realized later was <a href="http://twitter.com/bmizerany">Blake Mizerany</a> of Heroku/Sinatra fame, i.e. someone far more knowledgable than me about CLI apps, Ruby, and shell programming).</p>

<p>My answer was about as eloquent as a middle-school debate team closing argument and amounted to “Me hate bash.”</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Although I <em>do</em> dislike shell programming, it’s not exactly fair of me to transfer my personal preferences into solid “advice,” nor is it fair to imply that shell programming is a lame or worthless skill; it’s certainly not.</p>

<p>So, I thought about it a bit more and I have a <em>real</em> answer to the question “Why use Ruby instead of shell?”</p>

<p>Blake made the point that one of my examples (in Ruby) would’ve been very trivial in shell, and further that issues I was discussing could be easily avoided by simply better-wielding the shell.  His preference was to convert to Ruby only when things got complicated.</p>

<p>I would generally agree, for some definition of “when things get complicated.”</p>

<p>For me, things get complicated in shell <em>very</em> quickly…I’m just not a shell expert and likely won’t ever be.  A lot of developers aren’t shell experts, and are not going to be able to use the shell programming language <em>nearly</em> as effectively as they could Ruby.</p>

<p>So, rather than write <em>bad</em> shell code and then port to Ruby later (once you’ve made a mess), my advice, assuming you aren’t a shell expert and aren’t looking to become one, is to just start off with Ruby.</p>

<p>I say this because the average developer is much more likely to be able to write clean &amp; idiomatic Ruby code than to write similarly idiomatic shell code.</p>

<p>That said, I probably should become <em>more</em> of an expert on shell programming and would love some resources if anyone has any.</p>
