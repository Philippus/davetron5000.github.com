<p>You don&#39;t need schedule time to play video games</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/">Merlin Mann</a> has said this more than a few times on his great <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">podcast</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/danbenjamin">Dan Benjamin</a>, and it
really strikes a chord with me.  Not that I play video games (I don&#39;t), but the underyling message really speaks to me: “you don&#39;t need to schedule time to do
things you <em>really</em> want to do.”</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It&#39;s true; I don&#39;t have any problem finding time throughout the week to work on my book, or hack on <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gli">open source</a> stuff, or have a
great meal with my lovely <a href="http://twitter.com/amymaura">fiancé</a>.  What I <em>do</em> have a problem finding time for are the things I hate doing, but that I feel,
intellecutally, that I <em>should</em> be doing.</p>

<p>Given that, in less than two months, I&#39;ll be on a beach in Puerto Rico, getting married, and having my picture taken, I started to get
worried.  I&#39;m not obese, but I&#39;m far from a healthy weight, and I lead a mostly sedentary lifestyle.  I also rarely eat breakfast, leading
me to just devour massive amounts of food at lunchtime.</p>

<p>About once a month, I&#39;ll “buckle down” and make breakfast about twice, and make it to the gym a few times, and the back to normal.</p>

<p>Not this time.  Other than a life-long partner, the <em>other</em> thing from a wedding that lasts are the pictures.  And, if I can&#39;t get myself in
some semblance of shape for <em>that</em>, well…I just can&#39;t do it.  And I hate not being able to do things.</p>

<h2>Doing the things I hate</h2>

<p>My problem was this constant feeling of “not enough time in the day.”  We seem to have solved this problem <a href="http://www.heyitsopower.com">at work</a>, and that&#39;s
<em>way</em> more complex than my life.  </p>

<p>So, I started with a completely empty day, and started to carve things out, one by one.  </p>

<p>I wanted to leave work at 6pm every day. That means
getting there by 9:30am.  And if I want to go to the gym, I&#39;d need to be <em>done</em> working out by 9:00am.  I worked all the way through
everything I&#39;d need to do, including making breakfast and packing my bag the night before.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hyperschedule.png" alt="&#39;My Hyperschedule&#39;"></p>

<p>As you can see, I&#39;ve scheduled things down to the minute: I get up at 6:50, start making breakfast by 7, and clean it all up in time to
leave for the gym by 7:35.  I set each of these to loudly alarm on my iPhone, so I keep the right pace.  </p>

<p>And yes, I also planned when to eat
lunch and what to have (I eat at one of the same three restaurants every day anyway, why bother having to make the decision?).</p>

<h2>Does it work?</h2>

<p>So far, it has <em>totally</em> worked.  I&#39;ve <em>never, ever</em> in my life made it to the gym more than twice in one week.  EVER.  The first three
weeks, I made it 4 times each week, and did 30 minutes of cardio, plus stretches, weights, etc.  I was also in bed by 11:00 each night, with
my bag packed and ready to go.</p>

<p>And then I got food poisoning, forcing an entire week of <em>not</em> following this schedule.</p>

<p>I was really worried I&#39;d lost all my momentum, that maybe the
“newness” of this technique would wear off.</p>

<h3>I started right back up</h3>

<p>Not a problem; started back into my routine with no problems at all.  Now, I&#39;m not tracking calories, weight, or anything (this can&#39;t be about manipulating metrics, it has to be about establishing a healthy routine), but so far, I think this has the highest chance of working its way into my life.</p>

<h2>Why does this work?</h2>

<p>When I&#39;d make it to the gym, I&#39;d feel rushed.  “Shit, I have to hurry, so I can get to work in time to put in the right hours so I can get
home and then do fun stuff!”  “I won&#39;t go to the gym, because I overslept and I won&#39;t get a proper workout, so why bother?”  The excuses
went on and on.</p>

<p>Now that everything&#39;s scheduled, I&#39;m not rushed.  I never worry that I&#39;ll miss out on anything, because all of my “chores” are accounted
for: getting up in time to make a proper breakfast, getting to the gym in time to get a proper work out, getting to work in time to put in
my hours <em>and</em> leave at a reasonable hour, etc.</p>

<p>Getting ready the night before is also crucial: it reduces friction for the next day, and also represents a commitment to myself.  If I&#39;ve
already gone to the trouble of packing up my clothes and stuff for the gym, when I&#39;m groggy the next morning, trying to convince myself to
sleep more, I think about that bag: “Well, I&#39;m actually all ready, so I might as well actually go.”</p>

<h3>What about scheduling “free time?”</h3>

<p>I decided to explicitly <em>not</em> schedule “free” activities.  There&#39;s nothing on my calendar that says “work on book” or “make dinner” or
“watch TV with fiancé.”  As Merlin says, these don&#39;t <em>need</em> to be scheduled, and, honestly, free time doesn&#39;t feel free when the iPhone alarams are going off.  </p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>Keep doing it and hope my wedding pictures turn out great!  I&#39;ll report back after the honeymoon with the results!</p>
