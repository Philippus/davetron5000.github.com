<div><p>Co-worker sent out an email today, letting everyone know about a handy Mac app called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cdto/">cdto</a>.  You drag it to Finder and, if you
click it, it will open a Terminal window where the current working directory is the folder you&#39;re viewing in Finder.  Pretty handy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I click the link and get to a Google Code page, with a link to a zip.  Then, I thought, maybe the developer is being nice and has put
it in the App Store; that way, I can install it here with one click, and install it at home with one click.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>But, <em>another</em> developer has created a similar app called <a href="http://inscopeapps.com/#shellto">ShellTo</a>.  The icon is similar, and it does exactly the same
thing.  However, it&#39;s 99 cents.</p>

<p>Now, I have a bit of a dilemma.  Do I download cdto, find the expanded folder (called “cdto dist”) in my 
Downloads folder, search that for the executable (there were several directories, only one having the app),
drag it to the Applications folder and then repeat the process (which I can make <em>slightly</em> faster via Dropbox) at home?</p>

<p>Or, do I pay a buck to have this done instantly and painlessly?</p>

<p>I paid the buck.</p>

<p>If you could pay a dollar for 5 minutes of your time back, would you?</p>
