    <p>Some collegues and I were dicussing dupication in tests, specifically how much repitition of code across tests is acceptible.
On the one hand, you want each test to stand on its own and indicate what it’s testing.  On the other hand, just because we’re in
a test doesn’t mean that all the rules about duplication of code don’t apply; tests need to be maintained to, and if you make a
large change, you don’t want to have to change it in several places.</p>

<p>How much duplication is too much or, what does duplication in tests mean, and how does it affect the understandability and
maintainability of our tests?</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="what-is-a-test">What is a test?</h2>

<p>To know how our test code should be structured, we must understand what the purpose of a test is.  At its base, a test is some code that, when executed, checks that some other code behaves in a certain way.  This is a bare minimum, we also wnat our tests to describe the <em>behavior</em> of a piece of code.  We should be able to understand, from looking at a bunch of tests, what the code is supposed to <em>do</em> and what the <em>intent</em> of the developer who created it was.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the basic structure of one test</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-a-single-test">Structure of a single test</h3>

<p>A test is made of up three parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Setup</em> or <strong>Given</strong> - This part establishes the conditions under which the test will be performed.  This is crucial, and what makes programming hard - can we know <em>every</em> condition under which our code will run?  We call this “Given” because we simply “give” conditions to the code under test.</li>
  <li><em>Execute</em> or <strong>When</strong> - Here, we run the code we’re testing, usually by calling a public method from the class under test.  It’s called “When” because of phrases like “When I calculcate the sales tax”.</li>
  <li><em>Assert</em> or <strong>Then</strong> - The final part involves checking that what we executed in step 2 did what we thought it should do.  It’s
called “Then” because of the way we might state assertions in English - “Then the total should be $56.12”.</li>
</ol>

<p>A very simple test might look like this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby
def test_area
  # Given (setup)
  circle = Circle.new(10)
  # When (execute)
  area = circle.area
  # Then (assert)
  assert_equal 314,area
end
</code></p>

<p>Tests in real apps are rarely this simple and straightforward.  Often, complex setup is required to establish all the “givens”.
Further, the setup for several tests might be very similar, containing identical code with very small differences.  It’s these
differences that form the true picture of the behavior of code under test.</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-a-set-of-tests">Structure of a set of tests</h3>

<p>Let’s take a simple domain that it’s a bit more complex than our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Circle</code> class to see how tests interact.  Let’s test a class
that, given a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, returns a “salutation”.  What makes this tricky is that people in our system don’t always have a first
name or last name.  We want our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> class to handle this.</p>

<p>```ruby
class SalutationTest « Test
  def test_full_name
    # Given
    person = Person.new(“David”,”Copeland”,:male)
    salutation = Salutation.new(person)
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, David!”,greeting
  end</p>

<p>def test_first_name_only
    # Given
    person = Person.new(“David”,nil,:male)
    salutation = Salutation.new(person)
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, David!”,greeting
  end</p>

<p>def test_last_name_only_male
    # Given
    person = Person.new(nil,”Copeland”,:male)
    salutation = Salutation.new(person)
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, Mr. Copeland!”,greeting
  end</p>

<p>def test_last_name_only_female
    # Given
    person = Person.new(nil,”Copeland”,:female)
    salutation = Salutation.new(person)
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, Ms. Copeland!”,greeting
  end
end
```</p>

<p>Read these tests over.  They should, hopefully, give you a picture of what the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> class is supposed to do, even though
we aren’t seeing the actual implementation<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.  Of course, this isn’t perfect.  If you look over the test class
quickly, all the tests look similar, and it’s hard to tell what the differences are.  Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The assertions in the first two tests are identical. Is this by coincidence, or by design?</li>
  <li>This test is tightly coupled to the construction of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, even though this class doesn’t test that construction; we
simply want <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> instances of a certain nature.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these issues make it unclear what’s really being tested.  What part of each of these tests is <em>different</em> from the others
in a significant way?</p>

<h2 id="making-intent-more-clear">Making intent more clear</h2>

<p>Our first issue is that the first two tests’ assertions are identical.  This is, in fact, by design of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> class -
if the person has a first name, we don’t care if they have a last name.  Let’s make that design decision clear:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby
class SalutationTest &lt;&lt; Test
  def test_salutation_uses_first_name
    [ Person.new("David","Copeland",:male),
      Person.new("David",nil       ,:male),
    ].each do |person|
      # Given
      salutation = Salutation.new(person)
      # When
      greeting = salutation.greeting
      # Then
      assert_equal "Hello, David!",greeting,"For person #{person}"
    end
  end
end
</code></p>

<p>Now, it’s very clear that the last name doesn’t matter.  Note that since we’re now executing our given/when/then in a loop, we need to include the person used in the salutation in our assertion message so if it ever fails, we know which <code class="highlighter-rouge">last_name</code> caused it.</p>

<p>This clears up our biggest issue, but what about the duplication of creating <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> instances?  Outside of the fact that any
change in the constructor <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> will break this test, it’s also not clear what’s different about all of these <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>
instances.  Even if we’re familiar with the constructor, it’s still not 100% clear what <em>kind</em> of person we’re setting up as a
“Given”.</p>

<p>We could certainly drop a few comments in, but we have a more powerful tool: method extraction.</p>

<p>```ruby
class SalutationTest « Test</p>

<p>def test_salutation_uses_first_name
    # Given
    first_name = “David”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ person_with_first_name_only(first_name), 
  person_with_full_name(first_name) ].each do |person|
  # Given
  salutation = Salutation.new(person)
  # When
  greeting = salutation.greeting
  # Then
  assert_equal "Hello, #{first_name}!",greeting,"For person #{person}"
end   end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>def test_last_name_only_male
    # Given
    salutation = Salutation.new(male_with_only_last_name(“Copeland”))
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, Mr. Copeland!”,greeting
  end</p>

<p>def test_last_name_only_female
    # Given
    salutation = Salutation.new(female_with_only_last_name(“Copeland”))
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, Ms. Copeland!”,greeting
  end
end
```</p>

<p>Now, it’s painfully clear <em>which</em> type of person we’re setting up.  We’ve also been able to eliminate the <code class="highlighter-rouge">person</code> variable,
which was only really needed to construct the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Saluation</code> instance.  It’s existence muddied the test code, so the elimination
of that makes the tests more clear.  The extracted methods are trivial:</p>

<p>```ruby
def person_with_first_name_only(first_name)
  Person.new(first_name,nil,:male)
end</p>

<p>def person_with_full_name(first_name)
  Person.new(first_name,’Smith’,:male)
end</p>

<p>def male_with_only_last_name(last_name)
  Person.new(nil,last_name,:male)
end</p>

<p>def female_with_only_last_name(last_name)
  Person.new(nil,last_name,:female)
end
```</p>

<p>Granted, our test is a lot more lines of code than it was, but it’s also a lot more clear.  Since code is <em>read</em> much more often
than written, good, clean code should favor readability.  Our test code now does, clearly communicating, for each test, what the
conditions are under which we’re going to test, what code we’re testing and what behavior we expect our code to exhibit, all with
a minium of comments – the code speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Of course, we can still introduce further confusing duplication.  As our codebase grows, we’ll see that duplication will also
grow.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-in-the-face-of-change">Behavior in the face of change</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a new subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> called <code class="highlighter-rouge">FormalSalutation</code>.  This new subclass will implement the somewhat
old-fashioned notion of referring to married women as “Mrs.” and unmarried women as “Miss”.  It will also
spell our “Mister”.  We’ll copy the tests for
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> and enhance them as a naive first step.</p>

<p>```ruby
class FormalSalutationTest « Test</p>

<p>def test_salutation_uses_first_name
    # Given
    first_name = “David”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ person_with_first_name_only(first_name), 
  person_with_full_name(first_name) ].each do |person|

  # Given
  salutation = FormalSalutation.new(person)
  # When
  greeting = salutation.greeting
  # Then
  assert_equal "Hello, #{first_name}!",greeting,"For person #{person}"
end   end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>def test_last_name_only_male
    # Given
    salutation = FormalSalutation.new(male_with_only_last_name(“Copeland”))
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, Mister Copeland!”,greeting
  end</p>

<p>def test_last_name_only_married_female
    # Given
    person = female_with_only_last_name(“Copeland”)
    person.marry!
    salutation = FormalSalutation.new(person)
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, Mrs. Copeland!”,greeting
  end</p>

<p>def test_last_name_only_unmarried_female
    # Given
    salutation = FormalSalutation.new(female_with_only_last_name(“Copeland”))
    # When
    greeting = salutation.greeting
    # Then
    assert_equal “Hello, Miss Copeland!”,greeting
  end</p>

<p>private 
  def person_with_first_name_only(first_name)
    Person.new(first_name,nil,:male)
  end</p>

<p>def person_with_full_name(first_name)
    Person.new(first_name,’Smith’,:male)
  end</p>

<p>def male_with_only_last_name(last_name)
    Person.new(nil,last_name,:male)
  end</p>

<p>def female_with_only_last_name(last_name)
    Person.new(nil,last_name,:female)
  end
end
```</p>

<p>The tests are pretty clear as to what they are doing, but now we have two types of nasty duplication going on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some of these tests are identical to those in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTest</code></li>
  <li>Some of our private <code class="highlighter-rouge">person_*</code> methods are identical to those in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTest</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="duplicated-tests">Duplicated Tests</h3>

<p>What do our duplicated tests tell us?  They tell us that, for a person with a first name, irrespective of the existence of a last
name, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FormalSalutation</code> behave the same <em>only by happenstance</em>.  In other words, it is OK for the behavior of
these classes to differ in this situation, but, currently, they <em>happen</em> to behave the same.  Meaning that if we later change how
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> behaves, we don’t need to also change how <code class="highlighter-rouge">FormalSalutation</code> behaves.</p>

<p>The quesiton is: is this interpretation correct?  Let’s suppose that it isn’t.  Let’s suppose that, anywhere in our system,
anyone that uses a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code>-like class should expect that the behavior regarding a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> with a first
name should be the same.  Can we communicate that design decision in our tests?</p>

<p>We could do this by creating a module to hold our specific asserts, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTests::Asserts</code>, like so:</p>

<p>```ruby
module SalutationTests
  module Asserts
    def assert_greeting_for_person_with_first_name(greeting,first_name,msg=nil)
      assert_equal “Hello, #{first_name}!”,greeting,msg
    end
  end
end</p>

<p>class SalutationTest
  include SalutationTests::Asserts
  def test_salutation_uses_first_name
    # Given
    first_name = “David”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ person_with_first_name_only(first_name), 
  person_with_full_name(first_name) ].each do |person|

  # Given
  salutation = Salutation.new(person)
  # When
  greeting = salutation.greeting
  # Then
  assert_greeting_for_person_with_first_name(greeting,first_name,"For person #{person}")
end   end end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>class FormalSalutationTest
  include SalutationTests::Asserts</p>

<p>def test_salutation_uses_first_name
    # Given
    first_name = “David”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ person_with_first_name_only(first_name), 
  person_with_full_name(first_name) ].each do |person|

  # Given
  salutation = FormalSalutation.new(person)
  # When
  greeting = salutation.greeting
  # Then
  assert_greeting_for_person_with_first_name(greeting,first_name,"For person #{person}")
end   end end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>```</p>

<p>We’ve added lines of code, but now it’s clear that the behavior of both <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FormalSalutation</code> 
are <em>supposed to be the same</em> for a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> with a first name.  Meaning, if the behavior of one changes, than the behavior of
the other <em>must</em> change, and we can make that change, in our tests, in one place.  It also means that future
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code>-like classes can re-use this logic.  This is basic structured programming.</p>

<p>Onto our second form of cross-test duplication, the duplication in the setup of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> instances.</p>

<h3 id="duplication-in-setup">Duplication in setup</h3>

<p>In both <code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTest</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FormalSalutationTest</code>, we create a person with a full name, a person with no last name, and a
male person without a first name.  It’s done the same way in both test classes.  The code, as it stands now, is telling us that
this duplication is merely happenstance.  This is not correct.  We intended to create the <em>same set of circumnstances</em> in both
tests.  In one, the behavior is the same (by design, as indicated by the sharing of the assert method).  In the other
the classes, <em>under the same conditions</em> should behavior differently.</p>

<p>So, we’d like to communicatet this sameness that in our implementation.  We could use a tool
like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</a>, but this puts all of our test data into global scope.  We only want our test data scoped to the
tests in question.  This is so that data can change as those sets of classes change, and we can be sure we aren’t breaking other
classes.</p>

<p>We can do this without any special tools by using a module with a well-chosen name.  We’ll use our 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTests</code> namespace and create a new module inside called <code class="highlighter-rouge">People</code> that will contain our extracted methods.</p>

<p>```ruby
module SalutationTests
  module People
    def person_with_first_name_only(first_name)
      Person.new(first_name,nil,:male)
    end</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>def person_with_full_name(first_name)
  Person.new(first_name,'Smith',:male)
end

def male_with_only_last_name(last_name)
  Person.new(nil,last_name,:male)
end

def female_with_only_last_name(last_name)
  Person.new(nil,last_name,:female)
end   end end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>class SalutationTest « Test
  include SalutationTests::People
end</p>

<p>class FormalSalutationTest « Test
  include SalutationTests::People
end
```</p>

<p>It’s now clear that the setup for the first two tests of both <code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTest</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FormalSalutationTest</code> are the same <em>by
design</em>.   Note that if we <em>did</em> choose to move to FactoryGirl later on, we only need to update this module to use our
factories, instead of having to go into each test method and do it.  This is, yet again, basic structured programming.</p>

<p>What about the case when we want to re-use this setup, but change it slightly?  Should we re-use it, or duplicate it?</p>

<h2 id="when-we-need-a-slight-tweak-to-our-setup">When we need a slight tweak to our setup</h2>

<p>Suppose we want to make a third class, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">HonorificSalutation</code>.  Here, our setup is very similar, but not exactly the same,
as our common <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> setup in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTests::People</code>.  Since we don’t <em>have</em> to use this module, we could create <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>
instances exactly how we’d like, and make it clear that the tests in <code class="highlighter-rouge">HonorificSalutationTest</code> aren’t the same as those
in the other two.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t exactly true.  The setup is <em>almost</em> the same and, since these three classes are all related, it makes sense
to share the similarities.  We want someone to look at <code class="highlighter-rouge">HonorificSalutation</code> and know what’s <em>different</em> about this class
from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salutation</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">FormalSalutation</code>.  So, we re-use the methods from <code class="highlighter-rouge">SalutationTests::People</code> and modify the results during
the setup:</p>

<p>```ruby
class HonorificSalutationTest « Test
  include SalutationTests::People</p>

<p>def test_doctor_with_no_first_name
    [ male_with_only_last_name(‘Copeland’),
      female_with_only_last_name(‘Copeland’)].each do |person|
      # Given
      person.honorific = :doctor
      salutation = HonorificSalutation.new(person)
      # When
      greeting = salutation.greeting
      # Then
      assert_equal “Hello, Dr. Copeland!”,greeting
    end
  end
end
```</p>

<p>What this code is saying is that when we test a person who’s a doctor and has no first name, we want both a male and female
<em>exactly</em> like we had in our other tests, but the <em>one</em> difference between those tests and this is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">honorific</code>
is being set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">:doctor</code>.  This makes it very clear what’s truly different.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>There’s a lot more to this subject, but essentially what we’re getting at is the meaning behind duplication.  Essentially, things
that are the same <em>by desgin</em> should be shared.  Everything else is only the same by happenstance.  By coding your tests in this
way, you make the intent and design very clear.  And you don’t need any special tools to do it.</p>
