    <p>At the start of 2011, I <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2011/01/01/2010-whats-next.html">blogged</a> about a &quot;professional goals&quot; file I found on my computer, and
compared it to what happened.  I kindof enjoyed the exercise, so here&#39;s a repeat.  </p>

<h2>2011</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s what was on my list of goals for 2011:</p>

<h3>Deploy my iPhone app to App Store</h3>

<p>Sadly, <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2010/07/18/iphone-app-part-5.html">my app</a> is still floundering.  With the release of iOS5, it&#39;s even got some bugs.  I would like to either
re-implement or at least beef it up and get it into the store.  With the book done (see below), this might happen.</p>

<h3>Speak at at least 2 conferences</h3>

<p>Done and done.  I was lucky enough to speak at more than two conferences this year, including <a href="http://www.rubynation.org">RubyNation</a>,
<a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>, <a href="http://www.gogaruco.com">GoGaRuCo</a>, <a href="http://www.oscon.com">OSCON</a> and <a href="http://www.rubymidwest.com">Ruby Midwest</a>.  It was a ton of fun, but 
exhausting.  Probably going to dial that back this year.</p>

<h3>Publish my command-line application book</h3>

<p>My <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com">book</a> on command-line applications in Ruby is <em>done</em>.  It took most of my free time this year to get it to completion,
but it&#39;s done and should be out of beta real soon.  I love writing and so I&#39;m inclined to count this against myi &quot;blog twice a
month&quot; thing, but it took a lot more time than I thought it would.</p>

<h3>Develop and deploy an iPad app</h3>

<p>Not even close :(</p>

<h3>Blog twice a month</h3>

<p>I barely managed an average of one post/month.  This year will hopefully be better.  My main problem is that it&#39;s hard to find
interesting things to blog about.  I would much rather my blog be like <a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment&#39;s</a> than a grab bag of technical junk,
but I also don&#39;t want to have a blog like <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> that is just opinions and reactions (not that I don&#39;t
think that&#39;s a great blog or a great way to write, but it&#39;s just not what <em>I</em> want to blog about).</p>

<h3>Learn JavaScript more betterer</h3>

<p>I spent almost no time improving my JavaScript skills.  I&#39;m not particularly sad about it, but I would still like to be better at
it.</p>

<h3>Get my rudimentary scaladoc doclet accepted.</h3>

<p>I think that my patch inspired a change in the scaladoc tool that gives it doclet-like abilities, but I couldn&#39;t find the time to
do anything with it.   The Scala documentation is much improved over the initial version of Scaladoc2, but it&#39;s still pretty bad.
Sadly, I&#39;m not writing a lot of Scala at work, so I don&#39;t have the time or motivation to do much about it.</p>

<h2>2012</h2>

<p>All in all, I didn&#39;t hit everything I&#39;d hoped, but I&#39;m still happy with how things panned out.  I think the theme of 2011 for me
was &quot;Don&#39;t Get Pigeon-holed&quot;.  </p>

<p>While my job at <a href="http://www.opower.com">Opower</a> was great, I was doing a lot of Java and ready to move on, both technically and product-wise.  Instead of spending my
free-time refining my Ruby skills, I now apply them daily (along with a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/merbist/livingsocial">great team</a>), freeing up my after-work
time to other pursuits.</p>

<p>So, what <em>are</em> those pursuits?  I&#39;m not looking to dive into some esoteric new bleeding-edge language at the moment.  I&#39;d still
like to get better at JavaScript and Objective-C, and that might be enough &quot;new stuff&quot; for me for this year.
Additionally, I&#39;d like to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep writing, either the blog or a short self-published thing</li>
<li>Complete <a href="http://www.github.com/davetron5000/methadone">methadone</a> and release <a href="http://www.github.com/davetron5000/gli">GLI2</a>, so both of those projects can be in maintenance-mode for a while</li>
<li>Find a way to keep up with my Scala.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, hopefully I can spend more time on music and cooking this year.  Amy and I had a blast in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=culebra&amp;ll=18.310203,-65.29604&amp;spn=0.104138,0.158958&amp;hq=culebra&amp;radius=15000&amp;t=h&amp;z=13&amp;vpsrc=6">Culebra</a>
just making up dishes using the limited ingredients available on the island and I&#39;m just tired of eating sandwiches.</p>
