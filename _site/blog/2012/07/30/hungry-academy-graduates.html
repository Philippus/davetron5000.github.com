<div><p>An <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/with-hungry-academy-livingsocial-aims-to-build-its-own-techies/2012/07/29/gJQAH5Q2IX_story.html">article in the Washington Post</a> gives a good summary of <a href="http://hungryacademy.com/">Hungry Academy</a>, LivingSocial&#39;s experiment to train 24
motivated people to become fully-functional developers in just five months.  They worked hard and <strong>all</strong> graduated last week,
starting as official developers over the next week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The benefit, if all goes according to plan, however, is a fleet of engineers that can be hired en masse with a commitment to work at LivingSocial for at least 18 months. Unlike fresh hires, the academy students are already familiar with the companyâ€™s products and culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2-3-week-long projects they delivered over the course were impressive enough, but given that many of them didn&#39;t have any
professional programming skills beforehand, their progress has been amazing to watch.  The first half of this grand experiment is
over and it was a rousing success.  The second half - how well they succeed in the actual work environment - begins now.  I&#39;m optimistic.</p>
