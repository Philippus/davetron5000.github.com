    <p><a href="http://jessewolgamott.com/">Jesse Wolgamott</a> has launched a training course called <a href="https://rubyoffrails.com/">Ruby Off Rails</a>, which is geared toward helping existing programmers learn Ruby first, and <em>not</em> Rails.  </p>

<p>I heartily endorse this and highly recommend this approach if you want to &quot;get into Rails&quot;.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>When I first heard about Rails, I bought a copy of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> and was instantly confused as to what I was looking at.  What were all those <code>@</code> signs for?  Why are there pipes after the <code>do</code> keyword?  Where were all these methods coming from?</p>

<p>The answer was: Learn you a Ruby.</p>

<p>I am not the type programmer to just copy/paste code I don&#39;t understand.  I don&#39;t like &quot;magic<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&quot;.  I want to know, or at least have an inkling of, how the tools I&#39;m using work.  And there&#39;s no hope in understanding Rails without understanding Ruby.</p>

<p>I sold the book, and, using a Ruby book available on <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari</a>, started to learn Ruby the language.  I ignored Rails, and didn&#39;t even think about it.  Instead, all of the <a href="http://www.awesomecommandlineapps.com">command line apps</a> that I would historically write in Perl, I wrote in Ruby.  I wrote a <em>lot</em> of Perl in Ruby at first<a name="back-2"></a><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Eventually, I figured out how the language worked and, when it came time to do some serious Rails programming, I wasn&#39;t surprised by much.  I mostly just had to learn to navigate the documentation.  Even when I didn&#39;t know how something worked, I could usually have a guess, and I was usually right.  When I wasn&#39;t, I learned something new about Ruby.</p>

<p>It probably wouldn&#39;t have taken so long if I&#39;d taken a more focused approach like what Ruby Off Rails is doing (and, LivingSocial&#39;s <a href="http://hungryacademy.com/">Hungry Academy</a> as well, which starts with just Ruby before moving to Rails).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re tired of slinging Java/C#/PHP, but can&#39;t seem to get focused to learn Rails or Ruby, Ruby Off Rails seems like a good way to go.  It&#39;s not very expensive, and it&#39;s geared around writing code, not learning API documentation.</p>
