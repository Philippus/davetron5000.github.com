<div><p>One of my fellow developers asked me the other day if I had any good dotfiles for <code>bash</code>.  I realized I don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t even have <code>ll</code> aliased to <code>ls -l</code> like most of the known universe.  I realized that I like to run as stock as I can.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Here&#39;s what I have aliased in <code>bash</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">vi</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;mvim&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">ps</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;ps auxwwwwwwww&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">ls</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;ls -FG&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">irb</span><span class="o">=</span>pry
</code></pre></div>
<p>That&#39;s <strong>it</strong>.  I type <code>bundle exec</code> if I have to (and always in anger).  I have a function called <code>go</code> that sets up a few things for working on a particular project (e.g. <code>go gli</code> before I start working on <a href="http://davetron5000.github.com/gli">gli</a>), but otherwise, I type the commands as
they come and use whatever options I need at the time, even if I tend to use the same options a lot (e.g. <code>grep -r</code>).</p>

<p>Over the years, my muscle memory has evolved around <em>just using the shell as it is</em> and not wound around a lot of customizations.  As such, when I&#39;m tunneled into some production server, or other location where I don&#39;t have my dotfiles (such as another
developer&#39;s box), I&#39;m almost exactly as proficient as I am in my own environment.</p>

<p>Sure, it takes some probably-measurable amount of time to type <code>bundle exec</code> or <code>ls -l</code> instead of <code>bx</code> or <code>ll</code>, but I find I don&#39;t spend a lot of my time typing things.  I spend most of it reading and thinking, and there&#39;s really no shortcut for that.</p>

<p>Similarly, my global <code>git</code> config contains only one alias: <code>lol</code>, which shows logs on one line (<code>log --oneline --graph --decorate</code>).</p>

<p>My <code>.vimrc</code> is a bit of an exception, as I have a fair amount of default configuration overridden, but in terms of mappings, I still don&#39;t have that much set up.  I use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/">pathogen</a> plugins and know the shortcuts many of them provide (like the amazing <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails">rails.vim</a>), but I don&#39;t tend to customize them that much.  Here&#39;s all the
mappings I have setup:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&quot; cd to directory of current file
map c :cd %:p:h
&quot; open buffer list
map b n\be
&quot; next error
map   :cnext
&quot; fold this line
map f !!fold -w77 -s 
&quot; ^O tries to open the thing under the cursor using gf
map  sgf
&quot; Avoid annoying ^Z minimizing to nowhere
map  
</code></pre></div>
<p>Again, that&#39;s <strong>it</strong>.  Whenever I&#39;m in <code>vi</code>, <em>anywhere</em>, I&#39;m 99% effective.</p>

<p>I tend to automate things away when they become annoying, so I guess I don&#39;t tend to get annoyed by typing small words into the terminal.  My brain thinks in chunks of words, which is why I dislike abbreviations and acronyms.  They seem like a vestige of
the days when we had to write things instead of auto-complete them.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;d recommend all developers try to run as stock as possible.  I bet you won&#39;t be as slowed down as you think, and you won&#39;t feel hamstrung in an environment you can&#39;t totally control.</p>
