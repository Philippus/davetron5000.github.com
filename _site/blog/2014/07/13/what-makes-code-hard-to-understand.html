<div><p><a href="http://twitter.com/garybernhardt">@garybernhardt</a> linked to a short academic paper on code readability, called <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5257.pdf">&quot;What Makes Code Hard to Understand?&quot;</a>.  It&#39;s a quick read that details an experiment where researchers showed severals versions of the same program to a bunch of programmers and asked them to guess the output.  Each version had the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> and lines of code, but differed only in formatting, variable naming, and use of types.</p>

<p>Choice quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The physical aspects of notation, often considered superficial, can have a profound impact on performance [of programmers to understand what code will
do]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, in a program that relied on order of operations, two versions were given, one in which one space was used around operators (<code>zigzag</code>) and
another where the operators were all vertically aligned (<code>linedup</code>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programmers were more likely to respect the order of mathematical operations in the <code>linedup</code> version of <code>whitespace</code>, showing how horizontal space can emphasize the common structure between related calculations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, they presented three versions of code to calculate the area of a rectangle, using free variables, tuples, and a <code>Rectangle</code> class:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programmers took longer to respond to the <code>tuples</code> version of <code>rectangle</code> despite it having fewer lines than the <code>class</code> version. It is not uncommon in Python to use tuples for (x, y) coordinates, but the syntactic &quot;noise&quot; that is present in the tuples version for variable names (e.g., <code>r1_xy_1</code>) and calculations (e.g., <code>width = xy_2[0] - xy_1[0]</code>) likely gave programmers pause when verifying the code&#39;s operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was not something that was initially obvious to me as I learned programming, but I have come to realize the importance of typography in writing
  code.  From <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2013/05/17/source-code-typography.html">my post</a> on the subject over a year ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, it&#39;s not just the content - the code itself - that affects readability. How it&#39;s presented matters and if we&#39;re going to talk about presentation, we have to talk about typography.</p>
