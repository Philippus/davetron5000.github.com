<div><p>In reading &quot;The Swift Programming Language&quot; to prep for my <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2014/06/04/what-swift-tells-use-about-programming-language-trends.html">post on how Swift informs us about programming language trends</a>, I was surprised at how straightforward the language&#39;s features seemed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found myself nodding along with each feature introduced. Tuples: check. Named Parameters: check. Default Parameters: check. Protocols: check. Functions: check. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized it wasn&#39;t just because Swift has unsurprising features, but because I&#39;m familiar enough with enough other languages
that I&#39;ve experienced or used those features before.  Although I write mainly in Ruby and JavaScript at work, I have a lot of
experience with Java and C, and had my head was in Scala for quite a while a few years ago.</p>

<p>Although the forms of Swift&#39;s various features differ from their analogs in other languages, conceptually, they are the same: the
generic type system is similar to Java&#39;s, and the tuples are close enough to Scala&#39;s that all I need to do is understand the
syntax.</p>

<p>It really is true that the more languages you know, the easier it is to &quot;pick up&quot; new ones.  This is a <em>great</em> reason to 
<a href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">learn a new programming language every year</a>.</p>

<p>If all you know are dynamic languages like Ruby or JavaScript<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, or you are only familiar with Java or C#, you are increasingly at
a disadvantage when trying to acquire new skills.  Learning something like Swift (or Scala, or Elixir, or whatever) requires not
just understanding the syntax of the language, but the very <em>concepts</em> that underpin its features (some of which can be mind-bending).</p>

<sup>1</sup><strong>Particularly</strong> JavaScript.  It has probably the <em>least</em> features of any modern programming language. If you've never experienced a truly powerful and expressive language, you will be more and more behind as the industry moves on. JavaScript won't go away, but it's becoming assembly language.  You <strong>don't</strong> want to be an assembly programmer.<a href='#back-1'>â†©</a>
