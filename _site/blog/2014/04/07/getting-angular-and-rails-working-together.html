<div><p>I&#39;ve been doing a bit of <a href="http://angularjs.com">AngularJS</a> at work, and getting it all working with Rails, the asset pipeline, testing, and deployment was quite a
challenge.  It wasn&#39;t so much difficult to do, but difficult to uncover the right information.  So, I decided to compile it all in a nice tutorial and post it as a free mini-ebook, in web form, also known as a website<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://angular-rails.com">angular-rails.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Once you're familiar enough with Angular to start building an app, you'll find there are a lot of unanswered questions:
<ul>
<li>How do I serve Angular assets via the Rails Asset Pipeline?</li>
<li>How does Angular's templating system work with Rails?</li>
<li>How do I connect Angular to my Rails controllers?</li>
<li>How do I test my Angular code within a Rails app?</li>
<li>How do I manage all these JavaScript dependencies?</li>
<li>What challenges will there be in the production environment not present in the development environment?</li>
</ul>
I was able to find answers by piecing together information from Stack Overflow and various blog posts. You shouldn't have to do that.

<p>Check it out, start making some awesome Angular apps with Rails, and <a href="http://angular-rails.com/contributing.html">correct any mistakes you find</a>.</p>
