<div><p>In September 2011, I interviewed at Instagram.
While I didn&#39;t ultimately get/take the job<a name="back-1"></a><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, the experience had a pretty profound effect on me as a developer.  </p>

<p>What I learned during the interview process (which was really enjoyable, and became the basis for <a href="http://theseniorsoftwareengineer.com/interview_potential_co-workers_excerpt.html">my ideal technical interview process</a>) was just <em>how much</em> two engineers with relatively little experience could accomplish.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>My notes on the interview:</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li> a popular iPhone app</li>
<li> the back-end to serve millions and millions of users</li>
<li> an infrastructure that could be experimented with: attempt to run Mongo and see what happens</li>
<li> Implemented their data storage layer in Mongo, studied it, abandoned it</li>
<li> Enhanced their iPhone app with Open GL</li>
<li> Build, documented, and deployed an API and several clients</li>
<li> Created a demo using their API in Node</li>
<li> Have their entire infrastructure monitored; can identify any change in behavior of their system instantly</li>
<li> Have ready access to their data to support third-party hacking</li>
<li> Completely manage all of their servers</li>
</ul>

<p>These are two guys with very little experience.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you had looked at these developers&#39; résumés as of 2010, you would not find anything to indicate that they
could both design, build, launch, and maintain a hugely popular application used by millions of people
around the world..  And while I&#39;m sure the code
that powered Instagram back in 2011 wasn&#39;t the greatest, these two guys had basically done everything
from designing the UI to launching an API, to managing servers on AWS.</p>

<p>They did this without a QA team, a system “architect”, a product manager, a <em>project</em> manager, or a technical operations team.  </p>

<p>Before the interview, I didn&#39;t think such a thing would be possible.  I would&#39;ve assumed that such an
undertaking would require years and years of experience, with an army of specialists each laser-focused
on one part of a greater whole.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>To me, this is what I mean when I use the term <em>full stack</em>.  It&#39;s not just about working at any level of
the stack, but about <em>not being afraid to</em>.  When faced with any problem, these two guys didn&#39;t show
fear, and didn&#39;t shy away…they dug in.</p>

<p>I used to <em>hate</em> writing JavaScript.  Now, I have no fear and embrace it.  It turns out to be pretty darn
useful.  I used to immediately dismiss any solution that involved writing raw SQL.  I was above all that.
Now, I use it <em>a lot</em>, because it&#39;s the best way to solve a lot of thorny problems.</p>

<p>My current fear is around technical operations.  I&#39;m working on overcoming it.  It&#39;s going to make me a
better developer.</p>

<p>Examine your habits and patterns.  What do you <em>always</em> reach for?  What makes you feel uncomfortable.
What part of the software you build are you afraid of?</p>

<sup>1</sup>The process didn't get far enough along where they were deciding to make an offer or not.  We basically came to a point where I would need to be willing to move myself and my family out to SF so I could put in the blood, sweat, and tears necessary to help make them successful.  When I realized there was no way I could realistically do that, we split on good terms.  And then they got sold to Facebook for a billion dollars. Fortunately, I cannot stand Facebook and would <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2011/08/01/why-i-wont-work-for-google-twitter-facebook.html">never work there</a>.  At least, that's what I tell myself :)<a href='#back-1'>↩</a>
